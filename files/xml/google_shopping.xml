<description><![CDATA[No other mountain in the world is as fascinating as the Matterhorn. Since the dramatic first ascent in 1865, the drama and the myths have created a unique interest in this mountain, which has probably caused the deaths of more mountaineers than any other. Each year, thousands of climbers attempt to reach the summit, but only one in five succeeds. And every season, the mountain claims the lives of ten to twenty climbers. Steffen Kjaer describes his and his climbing partner Brian Jorgensen's attempt to make it to the summit of the Matterhorn. After careful preparation and perfect acclimatisation, they take off to face the challenge of their lives. On the descent, however, something goes wrong. All of a sudden, they find themselves caught in one of Matterhorn's countless and lethal rockslides...Besides following the author's struggles on the Matterhorn, this book also includes a range of short articles: it offers an account of the mountain's history, including the legendary first ascent in 1865, as well as a factual description of the symptoms and mechanisms of altitude sickness. Moreover, it contains portraits of local mountain guides and an eyewitness account by the former American President, Theodore Roosevelt -twenty years prior to his inauguration, he travelled to the Alps and climbed the Matterhorn. As a further bonus, the stories of the book are illustrated by spectacular photos taken by the author.Steffen Kjaer is a mountaineer and a journalist. In his books, he focuses upon the days in the mountains when fantastic experiences far surpass the risks they entail. He portrays life in the mountains as it can only be experienced in the light of one's own head lamp. For ten years, his best days have been those spent in the mountains, with ice axe in hand, wearing a backpack on his shoulders and his rugged mountain boots mounted with crampons.From his many climbs towards the most legendary summits of the Alps, he has collected the best stories of chance encounters with fellow climbers. He has often left the obvious track and so found new angles and perspectives in his pursuit of the ultimate stories and photos.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[A lighter, improved version of the original I-Beam krab; the DMM Spectre 2 has tweaks in all the right places: the only trad biner you'll ever need. The I-beam construction allows this 32g carabiner to amazingly hold 9kN with the gate open; an improved, deeper rope basket directs the load to the strongest point during a fall; and the shrouded nose reduces the chance of the gate opening when you really don't want it to. Ok, the DMM Phantom is lighter, but the Spectre works all year round - it's large enough to handle well even in winter gloves. If you count the grams but won't skimp on safety, you'll be more than satisfied with the Spectre 2.5-pack of assorted colours means you can colour-code your gear - grab the hex you want first time every time. And of course, a multi-pack offers great value for money.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[For DofE, backpacking, trekking and beyond, the Wild Country Trisar 3 has the stability and weather protection to rely on all year round. Lightweight and free-standing, it's easy to pitch well even on soft ground and will stand tall through even the more bracing of 3-4 season conditions. That's because the inner-first design keeps the profile smooth, meaning that wind skims over it rather than knocking it about.The Trisar 3 is also robust, so you can expect it to keep you dry reliably for a long time with a bit of TLC. Tough, high performance ripstop polyester fly and groundsheet combine with Superflex alloy poles to not only last, but also keep the weight very reasonable for the protection. And with a versatile door and adjustable venting the Trisar 3 has the features you need for a comfortable trip.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Better protection and a longer life for your tent; the Wild Country Trisar 3 Footprint adds extra beef against wet ground and sharp objects. Shaped to fit precisely underneath the sleeping compartment of the Wild Country Trisar 3 tent, your groundsheet will thank you for laying out the footprint before pitching.You'll see the other benefits after a night on muddy, wet ground when you pack up a clean, dry inner tent. The footprint has its own storage sack that keeps it separate and compact in your pack... or on the outside when it's really mucky. A small addition that makes a big difference to the life of your tent; buy a Wild Country Trisar 3 Footprint to make a difference to your camping life too.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The DMM Alpha Sport 25cm Quickdraw is what DMM believe to be the ultimate solid gate, sport climbing quickdraw. And here's why: If you do a lot of sport climbing a solid gate crab makes sense. Bolt hangers can be very unforgiving of lightweight biners, particularly if you are dogging about and taking repeated redpoint falls.The Alpha Pro and Clip are robust and strong enough to cope with the typical sport climbing scenarios, but what really makes them stand out from the crowd are the exceptional handling qualities.The distinctive shape of the carabiners is no accident. The kinked back bone and grippy groove pattern on the apex of the spine are there for a reason. These biners are very easy to handle - something we are certain you will appreciate when stretching up to make that just-in-reach, gripper clip.The Alpha Sport Quickdraw has an Alpha Pro and an Alpha Clip linked by a highly durable nylon dogbone. It now comes with a stylish logo and at the rope end biner there is a neat, injection-moulded keeper. This keeps the biner locked down and correctly aligned, ensuring easy clipping and optimum loading. It also protects the webbing from abrasion. Taken all round this is a solid quickdraw with all unnecessary weight removed, that looks and feels as great as it is for all levels of sport climbing.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Rockfax North Wales Climbs Guidebook covers the best climbing from the whole of this huge and varied area. It includes all the routes from the 2010 publication North Wales Classics, with expanded descriptions and much bigger photo-topos plus many additional crags.The book spans the major mountain crags from Llanberis Pass to Cloggy and from Ogwen to the Carneddau.

It also includes the Llanberis Slate quarries, Tremadog, the Moelwyns, the Gwynant Valley, Mid-Wales, Gogarth and the Ormes of Llandudno.As is normally the case with the selected Rockfax guidebooks, the choice of what to include is based as much on the crag it is on as the route itself. If a crag is included then they tend to include a good selection of routes on that crag.Crags describedSlate Quarries - Bus Stop, Dali's Hole, California, Australia, Serengeti, Rainbow Slab, Vivian QuarryLlanberis Pass - Craig Ddu, Clogwyn y Grochan, Carreg Wastad, Dinas Cromlech, Scimitar Ridge, Dinas Mot, Clogwyn y Ddysgl, Cyrn Las, Cwm Glas BachClogwyn Du'r ArdduLliwedd and Gwynant - Lliwedd, Clogwyn y Wenallt, Clogwyn y BustachOgwen - Tryfan, Glyder Fach, Gribin Facet, Cwm Cneifion, Cwm Idwal, Braich Ty Du, Carnedd y FiliastCarneddau - Craig Lloer, Carreg Mianog, Craig yr Ysfa, Craig yr Ogof, Lech DduTremadog - Cwm Silyn (Craig yr Ogof), Craig y Gesail, Craig y Castell, Pant Ifan, Bwlch y Moch, Carreg Hyll DremBetws y Coed and theMoelwyns - The Moelwyns, Craig y Tonnau, Carreg Alltrem, Clogwyn Cyrau, Clogwyn yr EryrGogarth - North Stack and Main Cliff, South Stack, Holyhead Mountain, RhoscolynOrmes - Upper Pen Trwyn, Lower Pen Trwyn, Castell y Gwynt, Castle Inn Quarry, Penmaen HeadMid-Wales - Simdde Ddu, Y Grisiau, Llechau Mawr, Barmouth, Craig Cywarch, Gist Ddu, Cadair Idris]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Easton Mountain Products ATR-50 trekking poles are made for strength and comfortable use at low weight - ideal for long use on demanding remote trips. The strength comes from the two-part construction - fewer joints = fewer weak points - executed in 6063 aerospace alloy for rugged durability at low weight.Meanwhile, comfort is ensured by foam handles and neoprene-padded wrist straps. ATR-50s are also easy to lock at your preferred length; simply twist the RockLock clamp to set the tension, flick it closed and you're set for the day. Supplied with interchangeable summer and winter baskets they're ready for anywhere you walk - an ideal first pair of poles or for backpacking, trekking and every trip where reliability is top of the agenda.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Platypus GravityWorks 4.0 litre Kit has all you need to provide clean, safe water for a whole group on a long, remote trip. Not only that, it's extremely quick and simple too, filtering all 4 litres in only two and a half minutes. This one-off special deal includes the filter kit along with a full set of replacement parts and a bottle adapter at remarkable value, so you're covered for many trips' worth of use.The GravityWorks system takes the effort out of filtering water - simply fill the 'Dirty' reservoir, hang higher than the 'Clean' reservoir and watch gravity do the work for you. No pumping, no squeezing. You can even keep re-filling the 'Dirty' reservoir to have eight litres of water ready on-demand - ideal for a group situation when water's needed left, right and centre. Plus when you're on the move again it rolls down to a tiny size and weighs less than 350g. For easy filtration that'll go on and on, you can rely on the Platypus GravityWorks System.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent climbing rope for the traditional climber who is not quite ready to take the big step to using thinner ropes. At 10.2mm the Beal Flyer is still not a large diameter, but is a good compromise between traditional ropes and the new breed of thinner rope. Flyer offers excellent handling qualities at a relatively light weight.For more information on beal technology and the beal guarantee clickhere]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Ben Nevis, the peaks of Glen Coe and the surrounding mountains give some of the best snow and ice climbing anywhere in Europe, when the conditions are right. So popular and well known is Ben Nevis, that in recent years, climbers from as far afield as Poland, Australia, France, Italy and the USA have been seen trudging the delights of the 'famous' Allt a'Mhuilinn approach. Hamish MacInnes and Yvon Chouinard have made films of winter climbing on Ben Nevis, as have French guides, who continue to bring clients back each year. Justifiably a good 'tick' on any discerning world traveller's itinerary. Many of the routes are longer than experienced anywhere else in British hills and of alpine-like seriousness. It is not a good idea to be lured onto the famous 'Tower Ridge' of Ben Nevis as your first Scottish winter climb! This new full-colour edition has over 700 routes, including the best of the new routes up to the 2002 season. The guide covers Ben Nevis, Carn Dearg, Aonachs Mor and Beag, and Bidean nam Bian, Buchaille Etive Mor and outlying peaks in Glencoe.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Leki Wanderfreund SpeedLock offers that bit of extra support when you're out and about, giving you the confidence to get off the beaten track. Supplied as a single pole, it's designed to be used when you can't fully rely on your feet - on uneven surfaces and to support a minor injury.The AergonMed grip is the biggest difference between this and other trekking poles. Made in an inverted 'L' shape, it's ideal for weighting from directly above, but can also be held round the neck for ascents. Tough plastic with cushioning rubber keep it sturdy but comfortable throughout the day. And SpeedLock adjusters make the Wanderfreund quick and easy to lengthen or pack away. A technical pole to give the support you need, grab your Wanderfreund and get going outdoors.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Leki Instructor Nordic Walking poles are the top adjustable poles of their range, with a carbon lower section and Shark grip for maximum comfort in use. They're made for heavy users - instructors and frequent walkers, as the carbon lower shaft absorbs shock better than aluminium. There's also a cork grip to keep your fingers dry and blister-free on every trip. The Trigger Shark attachment makes for easy detachment too; simply push the button and the loop slides straight off. Designed for all-out performance and comfort on the move, this is a top-end pole for the serious Nordic walker.LEKI Nordic Walking Poles are slightly modified versions of their world-famous trekking poles.

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest RidgeRest SOLite mat makes a great extra insulation layer under your self-inflating mat, but is also surprisingly warm on its own. ThermaCapture technology (the silver layer) works with the heat-trapping ridged structure to retain significantly more of your body heat than your average closed-cell foam mat. In fact, it does this well enough to be a very lightweight option for three-season use. And because it won't absorb moisture, it's happy on the outside of your pack, leaving you more room inside. Go anywhere and sleep on anything with the Thermarest RidgeRest.]]></description>

A pair of smartly designed straps that fit round both mattresses top and bottom, keeping them perfectly aligned and together all night. Large enough for all but the very largest, thickest mats (Size XXL MondoKings etc), the ladder buckles are adjustable so even two very different mats can be securely attached together. Extra comfort, less heat loss and no more ending up in a heap at the end of your tent. All from two easy-to-use straps in their own compact case.

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest Universal Couple Kit eliminates that annoying (and chilly) gap between your mattress and that of your partner when snuggling in a tent. A pair of smartly designed straps that fit round both mattresses top and bottom, keeping them perfectly aligned and together all night. Large enough for all but the very largest, thickest mats (Size XXL MondoKings etc), the ladder buckles are adjustable so even two very different mats can be securely attached together. Extra comfort, less heat loss and no more ending up in a heap at the end of your tent. All from two easy-to-use straps in their own compact case. The Universal Couple Kit makes all the difference for couples living under canvas.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Hubba HP Footprint protects your inner tent floor from sharp objects and muck, but also adds versatility to your MSR Hubba HP tent. Tough, PU-coated polyester adds an extra layer of protection from water seepage, with a hydrostatic head of 2000mm and a DWR coating. But the whole thing still only weighs 140 grams and packs to a minimal size in its own storage bag. It's shaped to fit perfectly under the inner tent, held in place with elastic loops. Which leads us on to the other major benefit - the option to pitch the flysheet over the footprint only for a seriously fast and light shelter. It's a small investment that makes a big difference to the life and useability of your tent - no MSR Hubba HP tent should be without one!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Quick Skillet adds that last bit of versatility to your lightweight cooking system, giving the option of frying without taking much extra space. Made from hard-anodised, non-stick aluminium it spreads heat to help reduce burning and is easy to clean afterwards. It's sized to fit snugly on the outside of an MSR 2.5 litre pot like that of the Quick 2 System, so the overall extra space required is minimal. Plus there's the added benefit of the folding Talon handle, making tossing, stabilising and moving the Quick Skillet unnoticeably easy. A major extension of your options with only a small increase in space - the Quick Skillet is the finishing touch to your arsenal for straightforward trail cooking.]]></description>

Inside, you can fit a DeepDish Plate and Insulated Mug each - these smartly-designed pieces fit perfectly to use the space efficiently as well as making eating off your knees as easy as it can be. There's even room enough for a third mug or a compact stove if space is at a premium. A compact cookset that won't bust the weight budget, the Alpinist 2 System is your all-in-one eating solution for lightweight trips.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Alpine Kitchen Set keeps your camp cooking essentials together and compact; a practical package for proper cooking on the trail. Folding alpine-style utensils and a bendable, lightweight chopping board provide much of the utility of this cook's friend. Accessorised with squeeze bottles for oil and soap, a condiment shaker and quick-drying tea-towel, you're set for even quite complex meals with the addition of your penknife. Best of all, the whole lot rolls up in the lightweight fabric case. About the best way to keep your cooking gear under control when it goes in your pack every day, the Alpine Kitchen Set makes a big difference to cooking out of doors.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Salt and Pepper Shaker will surprise you - it's remarkable how much difference such a small item can make. Very compact and designed to be easy to use, this little hero carries the critical condiments in sealed, separate containers. Whilst you fill it by removing the tight-fitting cap from the end, getting a bit out to add to food is simple with the flip tops. But not so simple that they'll come undone in transit. It's amazing how much effort MSR have put in to making this small essential perfect for proper cooking on the move.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Packed with MSR's latest technologies, the Lightning Axis snowshoes represent a giant leap in snowshoeing performance, ease and comfort. First, MSR's new Axis Gait Efficiency system allows you to laterally adjust bindings independently of the frame, ensuring efficient, parallel-tracking snowshoes, regardless of natural toe-out and toe-in stances. In addition, new SpeedLock bindings offer set-it and forget-it simplicity with all-terrain comfort, while new Ergo Televators save you on the steeps. And of course, you get the benefit of MSR's most aggressive, 360 Traction frames and Modular Flotation tails to provide you with the confidence and versatility you want to enjoy broad range of snowshoeing experiences.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This is the 'Big Daddy' of lockers - the ultimate rigging biner and one which is super strong and super tough.It is large enough to accommodate several knots and has a very wide gate opening - just what you need in a rigging situation. All of which makes it a great centre use biner, but the story doesn't end there.Despite its name, the Boa is surprisingly light; by giving it an I-Beam construction DMM have reduced the overall weight by almost 25%. Add in the fact that it is easy to handle in gloves and the appeal to winter climbers is obvious.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This is the 'Big Daddy' of lockers - the ultimate rigging biner and one which is super strong and super tough.It is large enough to accommodate several knots and has a very wide gate opening - just what you need in a rigging situation. All of which makes it a great centre use biner, but the story doesn't end there.Despite its name, the Boa is surprisingly light; by giving it an I-Beam construction DMM have reduced the overall weight by almost 25%. Add in the fact that it is easy to handle in gloves and the appeal to winter climbers is obvious.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The new Jetboil Sol is an ultra-compact cooking system using Jetboil's familiar PCS canister cooking technology. This version includes a titanium cup which saves an additional 40g with a weight of just 260g. Boil time for 0.5 litres of water is identical to the previous version at 2 minutes for both versions (aluminium cup version also available) as is the 12 liters of water boiled per 100g Jetpower fuel canister. So basically more of the same, but lighter and smaller.]]></description>

Helios lights quickly and reliably with the click of a button, and heats consistently down to the last drop of fuel. Helios is an all-in-one cooking system that covers the gamut, from melting snow to prepping robust meals for you and your crew.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[If you are travelling light and need your kit to stay reliably dry then the Exped Fold Dry Bag Ultralite XXSmall is definitely the way to go. As the name suggests, the dry bag serves to keep everything inside safe from the elements; all you need to do is fill it up with your clothes, food etc. then roll the top over three times and clip it together to make the bag airtight and fully waterproof, thus protecting all its contents.The 15 Denier Ripstop Nylon fabric is waterproof and extremely lightweight but still provides reliable protection so you can push harder through all weathers knowing your warm clothes will still be dry at the end of the day. The lightweight dry bag series comes in varying colours for each size, making it easy to organise your kit within your rucksack.If you've ever spent a night in a soggy sleeping bag or lost a camera to the elements, you'll know the true value of one of these wonders.]]></description>

The lightweight dry bag series comes in varying colours for each size, making it easy to organise your kit within your rucksack.If you've ever spent a night in a soggy sleeping bag or lost a camera to the elements, you'll know the true value of one of these wonders.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Exped Synmat 7 M is an exceptionally warm, comfortable and compact mat that using synthetic microfibre insulation, making it superior to standard sleeping mats.The microfibre filled chambers are stable and comfy with the insulation bonded to the upper and lower surfaces of the mat so that as the mat is inflated it opens out the insulation and avoids the lofting problems that occur with synthetic sleeping bags. This coupled with the brushed polyester top fabric, providing excellent slip resistance and comfort next to the skin, guarantees a good nights sleep.The integrated pump is easily operated and will fill the mat within a few minutes, using two wide valves to ensure fast inflation to its 7 cm depth. Warmer and more packable than a foam filled self inflating mat, the inflated Synmats are thicker than normal self inflating mats but slimmer than an air bed.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Exped Downmat 7 Pump is a 7cm thick sleeping mat that contains premium Goose Down to provide superb insulation from the cold ground.  To inflate the mat use the built in pump, and not your own breath as this will be damp and effect the loft of the internal down. The pump is easily operated and fills the mat in a few minutes. The two wide valves ensure fast inflation and simple deflation.Similar to a sleeping bag, baffles between the mat's chambers eliminate cold spots and promote a stable and supportive air cushion. Light foam blocks at the mat's ends prevent down from escaping or migrating between chambers. Laminated polyester fabric is both durable and airtight. The top surface of honeycomb textured fabric provides superior slip resistance and comfort next to the skin. Seams and valves are all high-frequency welded (most secure method of fusing fabrics and materials) to ensure mat durability and integrity.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This versatile, lightweight and strong seven and half inch diameter The MSR Alpine Plate takes durable practicality to extremes for all types of camping - virtually indestructible but still pleasant to eat from. Brushed stainless steel not only looks smart for longer, it also feels good and is exceptionally durable as well as easy to clean (ie scrubbable). You could even use it to gently heat food. The rounded bottom design is also multi-purpose - keeping your food safely in its depths, the shape allows several plates to nest compactly together alone or inside 2- or 3-litre MSR Alpine pans as in the Alpine 2 Pot Set. And best of all, they'll last through heavy use in even extreme conditions. Tough doesn't come looking much better than this.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Silva Field Compass demonstrates that straightforward can still be fully functional when it comes to a high quality compass. The small baseplate of the Field Compass is ideal for D of E and group use, as a first compass for smaller hands or for those travelling fast and light. That's not to say it's short on features though: you still get measurement scales in mm, 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 making it compatible with all the Ordnance Survey Explorer and Landranger series maps. It's easy to use too, thanks to the DryFlex rubber grip around the bezel; and hard to lose, with a detachable safety-release lanyard. When what you need is reliable direction-finding, you'll be well served by a Silva Field Compass.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The cliffs of the South of France rocketed to popularity back in the 1980s when it was realised what great climbing was available and how good the weather was down there. Since then other areas have attracted the attention of travelling climbers and once-popular venues such as the cliffs of the Calanques, Sainte Victoire and even the Verdon have rather fallen off the radar in recent years. Following from the recent well received France : Haute Provence guidebook, France : Cte d'Azur reassesses these famous cliffs and also includes some of the great venues around Toulon, the sunniest city in France. Plus there is the popular winter venue of Chteauvert, the less well known Esterel and Chteaudouble areas, as well as the world famous Verdon Gorge. Add in Saint Jeannet and a selection of cliffs in the Nice area and this will become an essential volume for any climber.Presented in the universally-praised Rockfax style, the book gives the reader with clear landscape photos of each crag, never-before-seen close-up photo-topos, and a wealth of action photos taken specifically for the book. Whether you're planning your trip from home, or choosing your next route at the crag, this guide has everything you're looking for.]]></description>

It solves the problem of modern climbing without a leash, and is fully adjustable so as to be as compact or indeed long as you require.The Grivel Double Spring Leash is a great little investment for making sure you won't lose your axes and similar tools when climbing.]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://www.theoutdoorshop.com/showPart.asp?part=PN212&amp;utm_source=Product_feed&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=1]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[An elastic sling system to avoid losing tools when climbing on rock or ice. This solves the problem for climbers who love climbing without a leash. The Single Spring is attached to the harness by looping it through the tape ring over the harness itself. The small carabiner is hooked onto the hole on the axe's head when using it to lean on when walking or through the hole on the spike when holding the shaft in traction. In both cases it is impossible to lose the axe. The system allows the climber to swap hands or tool easily without interfering with the manoeuvre thanks to it compactness and the arm can be extended to its limit thanks to its elasticity. Compact when required, long when required.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Silva Expedition 4 Compass has everything an experienced navigator could want in a baseplate compass, plus it's light, tough and fits in your pocket. There's barely a map that the Expedition 4 can't measure, with mm, inches, 1:50k, 1:25k, 1:40k and romer scales for GPS users all included on the large baseplate. A stencil hole and luminous markings further increase versatility, adding orienteering and night navigation to the list of activities that it's ideal for.This Silva compass is not only full of features, it's also easy to use, with three silicone feet to hold it in place on your map and a large magnifier for those busy, detailed areas. Supplied with an instruction leaflet and a lanyard to attach it to your map case or in a pocket, the Silva Expedition 4 is your indispensible friend for UK navigation during almost any activity.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This guide brings together the best ridge walks in Snowdonia. In describing them the author has tried to be both readable and accurate, which should help to explain the unusual layout. The raw material of the route - map, information, route description - is presented in four no-frills pages, while the general chit-chat and photographs are allowed to follow on at their leisure. This means you have the option to glance through one or the other according to need, and without having to plough through an unnecessary amount of verbiage.Because the book is designed primarily for the hill-walking enthusiast, the author has commandeered space traditionally reserved for introductory notes and lengthy topographical descriptions (using photographs to help compensate in this latter respect) in order to explore the hill-walking experience beyond what is normally possible in a guidebook.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[For centuries people have used snowshoes as a means of travelling in deep snow, but only relatively recently has snowshoeing become an activity that people do for pleasure. Nowadays, visit any winter ski resort and you'll not only find crowds of people heading for the ski runs but also a considerable number setting out on snowshoes.This book aims to show the keen hill-walker what snowshoeing can offer if you can walk you can snowshoe! Equipped correctly, with reasonable knowledge of winter conditions and dangers, you can enjoy hiking in the winter in terrain that would otherwise be inaccessible on foot. The Mont Blanc region of the European Alps is the perfect destination for a snowshoeing holiday, be it at a beginner level or for those with more experience who seek the heady joys of summits and treks in winter. This guide not only selects some of the best walks, hikes and treks in the region, all more or less within sight of Mont Blanc (given a clear day, good eyesight and some imagination), but it will also prepare you for the experience. There are sections on equipment, technique, hazards, preparation and nature, as well as 70 outings, ranging from the very gentle to the particularly strenuous. Each walk description is accompanied by practical information, timings and grade, and the routes are illustrated on clear overview maps.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[It sometimes seems that there are no inviolate places remaining to the adventurer in the Lake District. But this is not quite the case. Scrambling - ascending rock that is not usually difficult or steep enough to warrent the term 'rock climbing' - can take you to many exiting places, many well removed from the beaten track.Even in popular areas of the Lake District, by combining several scrambles you can often hardly touch a path and rarely see other people at close quarters. A good long scramble with interesting route finding gives a very satisfying way of exploring England's Lake District.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The second of a two-volume set of guides to scrambles in the Lake District.The set are based on 'Scrambles in the Lake District' and 'More Scrambles in the Lake District', two of the original scrambling guides to the Lake District by one of Britain's best-known climbers. Continually reprinted for 20 years these guides have now been fully updated and merged into two definitive guides, for southern and northern Lakes. (For details of 'Scrambles in the Lake District South', see below.) The Lake District's rich mix of rocks, gills and crags offers the scrambler a complex variety of routes, often well removed from the beaten track. Scrambling - ascending rock that is not usually difficult or steep enough to warrant the term 'rock climbing' - means you often hardly touch a path and rarely see other people at close quarters. This is a way of getting back to a wilder Lakeland and enjoying the freedom of rough mountain country.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR DragonFly enables serious cooking on serious trips; for group use and base-camping the precision control makes elaborate cooking possible. Despite the low weight and packsize, the low suspended burner unit has wide pot supports to take large pans up to 10 inches in diameter. Highly stable, the included heat reflector and wind shield work with the dual valve adjustment for exceptional control of the output. Use it with white fuel, kerosene, unleaded petrol, diesel or jet fuel - the versatility is endless, with Shaker Jet technology keeping field maintenance easy. The ideal stove for those who don't like to be limited, the DragonFly pushes the limits of cooking on camp.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR SuperFly with AutoStart sits in the sweet spot for cooking on expedition; big enough to be controllable for cooking, but still lightweight. It's not short on power either, boiling a litre of water in around three minutes. And it's extremely versatile thanks to the Multi-Mount fitting that allows the SuperFly to run on almost any self-sealing canister you'll find. This version comes with the AutoStart Igniter for convenient start-up, though it is removable to save weight. Made to allow effective cooking of simple meals, the adjustable flame and wide burner head will make it possible to eat proper food on every trip. And the wide supports are great for large pots but twist away for packing. MSR's most versatile canister stove, the SuperFly makes eating easy on the trail.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR XGK EX stove is not self-conscious in any way - almost obscenely powerful it's the most reliable multi-fuel stove ever built. It's designed to work in the places where other stoves just won't - in extreme cold, at altitude and where regular fuels aren't available. The XGK EX can be used with diesel, unleaded petrol, kerosene, jet fuel and aviation fuel as well as the cleaner white gas, so you'll never be stuck for a means of cooking your dinner. It's built to last too, the rugged, highly stable construction and unique fuel delivery system ensuring a long life with fewer clogs. The ultimate in snow-melting, water-boiling efficiency, the XGK EX won't be beaten on all-round toughness.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[An MSR Titan Kettle is the one multi-functional item to do all your cooking on a weight budget. Though it's seriously lightweight at only 118g, it's a remarkably flexible pot - cook in it, eat from it, boil water in it and even drink from it. A folding wire handle facilitates moving the kettle around while hot, but won't take up extra space in your minimal kitbag. There's even an efficient little spout, making pouring easier without making packing hard. And the snugly-sealing lid keeps your fuel requirement to a minimum. Made for those ultra-lightweight trips when every gram is considered and simplicity is king, the Titan Kettle rules the lightweight roost for heating and eating pre-packed food. ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR DragonFly Fuel Pump is a replacement part specifically for the MSR DragonFly multi-fuel stove. Extremely strong and durable thanks to its fibreglass reinforcement, this latest interation also has a smart valve design which improves flame control, while the seal is more reliable. The DragonFly pump is specialised for exceptional flame control with an adjustable valve on the pump itself. Can be used to upgrade older stoves to increase performance or to replace worn parts and avoid replacing the whole stove.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Black Diamond's Fifi Hook is a quick and easy to use tool designed for aid climbing. This simple bit of gear is invaluable to aid climbers and key to any arsenal for assaulting a big wall due to its ease of use; simply weight the hook and look to continuing up. The Fifi Hook has a large hole at the bottom for connecting to your harness and a smaller hole at the top for connecting a retrieval cord. It's basic function is to hook into gear and take your weight.Please note that the Fifi Hook offers very little strength compared to a locking carabiner and, due to its open shape, requires a great deal of care when used.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[A Black Diamond Dynex Daisy Chain 140cm makes clipping in to belays and anchors a cinch on big walls and multi-pitch climbs. Tightly woven for a reassuringly stiff feel, the abrasion-resistant Dynex material weighs a minimal 43g and folds very small for transport. It's also handy in use thanks to the half-twists in the endloops that let it lie neatly when lark's footed into your belay loop. Instant length adjustment at seriously low weight, just remember to reverse-clip the endloop as well as a pocket for full strength in a fall.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Black Diamond Superslacker is a traditional, reliable rope bag with a courier-style shoulder strap and fold out tarp to protect your rope.Once easily carried to the crag, simply unsinch the drawcord closure at either end, undo the full zip and roll out the rope - for better rope management, tie either end to the provided loops on the bag. The intuitively designed but simplistic Superslacker allows you to keep your rope clean and tangle free and provides ample room for you to flake your rope onto, whilst the 420 Denier packcloth is tough enough that durability isn't a worry.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Check out the Black Diamond Deploy 3 Shovel if you want a design that's light, small, fast, and simple. The Deploy 3 Shovel's handle collapses into the blade for a tiny 17.3in package that's entirely self-contained. Just give the handle a pull, and its trapezoidal shape ensures it slides and locks into place. No more messing with frozen buttons or handle parts buried in your pack. In addition to this Black Diamond shovel's amazing simplicity, it weighs only 20oz, making it a great choice for alpine climbing and lightweight backcountry tours.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Never run out of travel clothes again; with a bottle of Lifeventure Fabric Wash you can have clean laundry wherever you are, even without a sink. This useful flat bottle contains a concentrated formula that works anywhere from hotel sinks to remote streams. Requiring only a little bit for clean clothes with a lovely fresh smell, a single bottle lasts a surprising time for adventure travel and family camping. In fact it's so small and light that even long-distance backpackers and gap-year students won't begrudge it a little space for the benefits. Travel is more enjoyable when your clothes feel good and as Lifeventure Fabric Wash is safe for most fabrics you can't go wrong with a bottle in your bag.]]></description>

In fact it's so small and light that even long-distance backpackers and gap-year students won't begrudge it a little space for the benefits. Travel is more enjoyable when your clothes feel good and as Lifeventure Fabric Wash is safe for most fabrics you can't go wrong with a bottle in your bag.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Navigation for Walkers is an easy to follow instruction book on how to fully understand and use maps, and the freedom this gives to navigate and complete any walk in the British countryside. Profusely illustrated in colour with 50 linked pairs of landscape photographs together with their exact map extract alongside. If you are at all apprehensive about taking the first steps exploring the countryside around you, then 'Navigation for Walkers' will certainly start you on the right path to aquiring the skills to navigate and complete any walk in Britain. Only with a good understanding of maps and by using them correctly can any walker truly experience the quiet exhilaration and freedom of walking centuries old paths, bridle and green lanes which make up the thousands of miles of public rights of way that criss-cross Britain's uniquely beautiful and often remote open countryside. Based on the Ordnance Survey's new Explorer maps, as well as the Outdoor Leisure and Landranger series, this book takes the reader step by step through the essential techniques of map reading, navigation skills, reading the compass and route planning. Julian Tippett has fifty years experience of route finding by map in the hills and moors of Britain; he teaches navigation skills and advises both the Ramblers' Association and the National Navigation Award Scheme.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Of the seven summits, Aconcagua (at 6962 m/22,840 ft) lies second only to Everest. Yet it is surprisingly free of snow and ice, and experienced hikers can reach the roof of the Americas without technical expertise. However, it is one of the world's highest and toughest treks.Author Harry Kikstra has summited twice, and explains in detail how to tackle the main trekking routes (Normal and Polish Traverse), as well as giving a useful summary on the technical Polish Glacier route. This pocket-sized guidebook has a wraparound map flap, open-flat binding and waterproof paper. It contains all you need to plan and enjoy your summit attempt.]]></description>

You'll see the other benefits after a night on muddy, wet ground when you pack up a clean, dry inner tent. The Footprint has its own storage sack that keeps it separate and compact in your pack... or on the outside when it's really mucky.A small addition that makes a big difference to the life of your tent; buy a Terra Nova Hyperspace Footprint to make a difference to your camping life too.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Platypus Hoser 1L is the economical hydration system you can rely on - lightweight, tough and easy to use it's ideal for DofE and day walking. Platypus strive to make all their hydration systems the best in the world, letting you stay hydrated literally on the move. The Hoser lives up to this with its durable, BPA-free film and taste-free lining, welded together with a handy carry handle. With just the one opening for filling, cleaning and drinking it's very simple to use as well as to carry. Plus the threaded neck takes the screw-on hose, a push-pull cap or a closure cap for storing your water. Treated with Platypus' SlimeGuard antimicrobial technology and with the easy-clean HyperFlow bite valve it's also easy to maintain, making it the ideal choice for occasional or new walkers.]]></description>

The ultra-fine mesh is stitched directly onto a wide-rimmed, pop-up hat meaning that the Head Net Hat is ready for use straight from its case. Manufactured from tough, multi-filament Tricot material, and with a toggled draw cord around the rim, the Head Net Hat weighs just 95 grams.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Ridges are epic, graceful carved walkways slung between summits, twisted spines of stone - these can be the most beautiful of mountain landforms. With elegant lines and giddy exposure, ridge climbs emit a powerful siren call, drawing us out onto the rocks. Life on the edge has a special quality, born of the contrast of empty space all around, and intricate detail in close-up. The crests are strangely irresistible. Scotland's ridges are among the finest mountaineering lines in the country, every one a unique adventure. The variety of these routes reflects the breadth of the mountain experience: a rich mix of summer scrambles, technical rock and challenging winter climbs. This book covers both the popular classics and some obscure gems, aiming to celebrate these thrilling climbs as much as to document them. The chosen selection spans the grade range, with routes to suit all levels of ability. Whether an earthbound hillwalker or an accomplished climber, Scotland's ridges cannot fail to stir your imagination.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest NeoAir XLite Women's Regular uses NeoAir technology to reduce the weight you need to carry on three-season trips. Warm, comfortable and extremely lightweight, the NeoAir XLite is the lightest of the NeoAir range, 15 to 25 percent lighter than the XTherm equivalents. The streamlined shape facilitates the XLite's extreme packability, while continuing to provide the comfort you need for a good night's sleep in the backcountry. The Women's version offers extra warmth in addition to plenty of sink-into-it support for your whole body. You'll never need to balance comfort with pack weight again with the Thermarest NeoAir XLite Women's Regular.]]></description>

Patent-pending diagonal-cut foams reduce convective heat loss through the mat, making it the ideal choice for ski-touring, cold weather expeditions and winter camping.Self-inflating foam is substantial enough to keep you comfortable while mountaineering or ski touring, yet rolls up small and light enough that you'll have no problem taking it as far as you want to go. Especially as the Small version provides cushioning for just your torso to save weight.

<description><![CDATA[To go fast you've got to go light, but that's no reason to be uncomfortable - the Therm-A-Rest Prolite Small Mattress gives the best of both worlds. It's made from materials selected for packability and light weight, but you'd be wrong to think that it's all about the carry as 2.5cm of high-quality foam is more than enough for a good night's sleep. For minimalists and very young campers and backpackers, the Small size offers a way of cutting even more weight off your pack while retaining comfort and insulation at night.It's the precision cut-outs in the foam that make the Prolite the lightest and most compact mattress available without impacting on comfort. Shaped for longevity, the holes shave out the maximum possible weight while maintaining the support and insulation needed for three-season trips. Further aided by the tapered, rounded shape that cushions your shoulders and hips, the Prolite Small tips the balance at 310 grams and rolls down to only 8 cm diameter yet has enough warmth and comfort for anyone who doesn't suffer from cold feet. For a quiet night's sleep after a long day on the trail, you won't find a smaller, lighter mattress than the Prolite for the warmth.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[To go fast you've got to go light, but that's no reason to be uncomfortable - the Therm-A-Rest Prolite Small Mattress gives the best of both worlds. It's made from materials selected for packability and light weight, but you'd be wrong to think that it's all about the carry as 2.5cm of high-quality foam is more than enough for a good night's sleep. For minimalists and very young campers and backpackers, the Small size offers a way of cutting even more weight off your pack while retaining comfort and insulation at night.It's the precision cut-outs in the foam that make the Prolite the lightest and most compact mattress available without impacting on comfort. Shaped for longevity, the holes shave out the maximum possible weight while maintaining the support and insulation needed for three-season trips. Further aided by the tapered, rounded shape that cushions your shoulders and hips, the Prolite Small tips the balance at 310 grams and rolls down to only 8 cm diameter yet has enough warmth and comfort for anyone who doesn't suffer from cold feet. For a quiet night's sleep after a long day on the trail, you won't find a smaller, lighter mattress than the Prolite for the warmth.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR MicroRocket stove takes full-on burning performance to the extremes of low weight and packsize. The little brother of the MSR PocketRocket is small enough to fit into an MSR Insulated or Stainless Steel Mug. But it unfolds with a few snappy moves into a miniature powerhouse capable of boiling a litre of water in three and a half minutes. It's also specialised to keep heating your food if the breeze gets up, with a WindClip protector on the focused burner head. And it's supplied with a smart piezo igniter whose fuel-gathering tube makes lighting the stove more reliable in the wind. The mountain marathon-runner's friend, the MSR MicroRocket lets you cut down on weight but not performance.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR WhisperLite Universal stove gives you the best of both  worlds for cooking on every trip, burning both canister gas and liquid fuels. Use gas canisters when they're available, set on a stand to enable liquid feed - great for cold conditions. But for longer, more remote trips and really cold weather the WhisperLite switches to burning a range of liquid fuels with a minimum of fuss. Better still, Air Control technology maintains the efficiency by optimising the fuel-air mixture for each type. The WhisperLite Universal backpacking stove is made for straightforward cooking -  particularly when burning gas canisters it has the broad burner head and simmering capability for things like pasta and simple sauces. The lightweight but stable design folds to fit in larger pans and the stove is easy to maintain on a trip with Shaker Jet technology and simple disassembly. Specialised for everything, the WhisperLite Universal deserves its reputation as the most effective hybrid-fuel stove ever made.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR WhisperLite International Combo is a legend in the multi-fuel game, letting backpackers cook simple meals efficiently using a wide range of fuels. The Combo includes a mid-sized MSR fuel bottle, meaning that you just add fuel to get going. Ideal for long trips when gas canisters aren't an option and for cooking in cold conditions or at altitude, the WhisperLite International is made tough but lightweight for expedition life.This proven backpacking stove is excellent for straightforward cooking; the broad burner head and moderate flame adjustment give you enough flexibility to simmer and heat foods like pasta, rice etc. The lightweight but stable design folds to fit in most pans and the stove is easy to maintain on a trip with Shaker Jet technology and simple disassembly. Optimised for the demands of extended trips abroad, the WhisperLite International marries efficiency to performance in one compact package.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR WindPro 2 stove is ultra-efficient, extremely stable for large pans and weighs less than 200g, plus it's got the flame control for proper cooking. Especially useful in cold conditions, the WindPro's remote canister stand enables liquid feed to the burner for more consistent performance through the life of the canister. The burner itself is also well-designed, with wide, sturdy legs and pot supports that take pans up to ten inches in diameter. The wide head spreads the heat so that with the fine control you can find the ideal level for whatever you're cooking. Highly efficient in more ways than one, the WindPro 2 is the lightweight option for elaborate and group cooking on the trail.]]></description>

The key is hidden inside - the body of the peg is a carbon fibre tube, protected by an aluminium skin and with a hard plastic tip to penetrate the earth. While clearly they require a little care in pitching to achieve a long life, these remarkably pins will amaze you with their performance and help to shave even more grams off your minimalist pack.]]></description>

Hanging tarps, replacing guylines and making temporary repairs or washing lines are some of the more usual uses of this handy stuff.3mm in diameter for plenty of strength, it shows up brilliantly in the merest hint of torchlight. That makes it fantastic for marking your territory on a busy campsite or even making lightweight, night-visible zip pullers. You could even mark a trail to the natural bathroom or lay it round your tent to avoid people tripping over pegs. CamRing Cord Tensioners extend the possible uses, letting you create a great level of tension with ease. It's amazing what you can do with a bit of accessory cord - the Reflective Cord Kit is a must-have item in any standby repair kit.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[If you don't get on with the average guyline runner, you need MSR CamRing Cord Tensioners to cut both weight and hassle in one. Sliding easily then locking securely, they're seriously easy to install and even easier to use.Simply thread your guyline through two adjacent holes, then in through the third, knot and you're done. The camming action provides tenacious hold in the windiest conditions and 6000-series aluminium barely weighs anything. A smart upgrade or reliable replacement for your lightweight tent.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[If you don't get on with the average guyline runner, you need MSR CamRing Cord Tensioners to cut both weight and hassle in one. Sliding easily then locking securely, they're seriously easy to install and even easier to use.Simply thread your guyline through two adjacent holes, then in through the third, knot and you're done. The camming action provides tenacious hold in the windiest conditions and 6000-series aluminium barely weighs anything. A smart upgrade or reliable replacement for your lightweight tent.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Universal Gear Loft fits almost any small tent, giving you extra space and making it easier to dry small items and keep your gear in order. On longer trips and overnighters alike, having a place to keep things like headtorches, snacks and socks can make a massive difference to tent life. Being mesh, this handy add-on shelf is particularly useful for keeping bits of gear in reach and fits virtually any tent thanks to the highly adjustable straps. It's even got a zipped pocket for the really small stuff. And the flexible wire frame lets it pack away in seconds. Simple but effective - the Universal Gear Loft is just the way good design should be.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Trek's mission is simple: to achieve optimum performance while moving fast in extreme environments by providing highly technical, yet lightweight eyewear. For those committed to the outdoors via mountaineering, climbing and trail running, the Trek is the perfectcombination of technical mountaineering principles and lightweight performance ergonomics. Detachable shields block lateral rays from intense glare as well as offer superior ventilation when necessary. Julbo's Flex Nose design and 360 adjustable temples provide optimum hold.The Spectron 4 lens is light but with excellent shock resistance. This versatile lens is suitable for all types of sports activities.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Leki Micro Vario Titanium Poles are so light and easy to pack that you'll wonder how you ever got on strapping your sticks outside your pack. An evolution of the popular Leki Micro Sticks, Micro Varios offer a similarly lightweight solution with the added benefit of length adjustment to fine-tune them or for ascent.Despite the name, they're actually made from high quality aluminium for lightweight durability. Push-button assembly is quick and easy as well as highly reliable thanks to the kevlar-reinforced tensioning rope and the SpeedLock lever fastening provides 20cm of continuous length adjustment to get them the right length for you. Then when you reach the Via Ferrata or need to pack for your flight, just fold them down for a tiny 38 cm packed length, plenty small enough to go inside your pack or case.Lightweight doesn't have to mean compromising comfort either, since the hollow Aergon grip has no edges to dig into your hand and can be held in a number of ways. Versatile, strong and highly packable; the Micro Vario Ti pole is the lightweight hiker's dream pole.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The updated DMM Cirque Alpine Hammer provides the functionality you need in a second axe when walking becomes climbing. Designed to be fully trustworthy for self-arrest and a last option for belay anchoring, the T-rated pick and shaft combine with double-riveted construction to give the Cirque a reassuringly solid feel. The new hammer option even allows use when placing pitons in ice or cracks. The slightly curved shaft adds enough climbing functionality to this all-rounder for it to be practical as a second axe for steeper sections. Winter scramblers and walkers who enjoy some chilly verticality will love the versatility of the latest DMM Cirque.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The updated DMM Cirque Alpine Hammer provides the functionality you need in a second axe when walking becomes climbing. Designed to be fully trustworthy for self-arrest and a last option for belay anchoring, the T-rated pick and shaft combine with double-riveted construction to give the Cirque a reassuringly solid feel. The new hammer option even allows use when placing pitons in ice or cracks. The slightly curved shaft adds enough climbing functionality to this all-rounder for it to be practical as a second axe for steeper sections. Winter scramblers and walkers who enjoy some chilly verticality will love the versatility of the latest DMM Cirque.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Winter climbing protection is often about making the best of what's available. In an ideal world, this would be ice screws in bullet hard ice and 'bomber' rock pretection throughout. However, our winter world is far from ideal and so inventive use of DMMs' Bulldog has been crucial in offering protection in frozen turf, thin icy cracks and marginal ice smears for over a decade. DMMs' updated bulldog keeps its versatility, but it's lighter, easier to place and easier to remove than it's predecessor.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Ultra O Screwgate could be described as the perfect aid climbing biner - it certainly performs remarkably well in the big wall environment and the I-Beam construction gives it an excellent strength to weight ratio.Perhaps multi day ascents, sac hauling, portaledges and extreme dehydration (eek!) are not your bag, but that doesn't mean you should turn your back on the oval biner design, far from it.At some point all of us will need to use a pulley system, most likely in a rescue situation. Oval biners are important because they allow pulleys to sit in a correctly loaded and equalised position.The symmetrical shape also stops them shifting under load and potentially dislodging a marginal gear placement. The locking gate adds a final element of security to the system.]]></description>

Fitting the HyperFlow valve to Platypus Hoser and Big Zip systems is extremely simple - pull off the old mouthpiece and pop on the new. So easy in fact, that it's worth considering instead of doing the fiddly cleaning an old, furred-up bite valve. Of course, it's also useful if the original valve goes missing. Give your Hoser a new lease of life - fit a new HyperFlow Bite Valve for top performance and ease of use.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Canyoning, the descent of natural gorges by a mixture of hiking, scrambling, swimming and abseiling  is a spicy mix of the fun and the adventurous. This is a guide to canyoning in the limestone areas of the western Mediterranean, stretching from the Costa Blanca via the Pyrenees to Provence, Sardinia and Mallorca. Selective in nature, it includes a selection of recommended gorge descents, ranging from two-hour strolls to long-day aquatic expeditions. The more technical expeditions invariably involve abseiling and scrambling. Yet most canyons are within reach for anyone in possession of these skills and, in the case of wet canyons, a one-piece wetsuit. The friendly Mediterranean canyons are great places to 'learn the ropes', and the guide therefore provides a basic grounding in techniques and skills for the less experienced.Want to come and see what's around the next corner?]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Try as we might to avoid it, there are occasions when we have to rely upon marginal gear placements. Whether that's a small, but crucial wire, or a suspect ice screw placement is not important. What matters is that we can improve the odds of it holding under impact. The answer to this conundrum is the Ripstop.These cleverly constructed quickdraws contain sections of weaker stitching that are designed to break when shock loaded. Each of the stitches that break absorbs some of the energy that would otherwise have been transferred into the marginal runner.The overall effect is to reduce the peak impact force, which is a rather fancy way of saying that your gear is less likely to rip.Keep one clipped to your harness; you never know when you'll need it next.]]></description>

Continual innovation with input from top climbers means their range includes some truly world-leading products.The Dyno is a taco-style bouldering mat for problems where height of fall isn't the main problem. The high density layers are thick enough to protect over the whole surface of the mat, with no folds or joins, but thin enough to wrap and mould around and into rocks and crevasses, and the smaller than average total thickness allows use where there is limited clearance from the floor.Top quality materials, moveable straps for options when carrying and a starter carpet for cleaning your shoes off combine to make this your indispensible friend on every bouldering trip to places like Burbage and Font.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Aero Straight Gate Black is a versatile biner that's useful throughout your rack, but particularly for clipping on to bolts. Easy to clip and unclip thanks to the clean nose, it's now even easier to handle and grip with improved gate shaping. Tactical black anodising adds a different colour option to your rack organisation or aids low-profile night climbing. An improved version of a favourite karabiner; choose the 2013 Aero Straight Gate when you can afford a couple of extra grams for loads of extra handleability.]]></description>

It is designed to work at the rope-clipping end of a quickdraw; the bent gate giving a quick and easy clip every time.It also has a large (26mm) gate opening and a clean nose design to reduce snagging.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Faster, safer, lighter: you can't lose with the Grivel Speedy short ice screw, and you can't lose it either! Ready to go with a freely rotating shackle holding the 20cm Dyneema sling and Gamma carabiner, the possibility of dropping the screw before placing or after removal is virtually negated. Just clip it into the rope before placing and you're covered, then when it's safely back on your harness use the handy ring to keep the krab from dangling. The Speedy ice screw weighs 15% less than the equivalent screw/quickdraw combination and makes the whole placement process quicker and easier - a bonus on cascade ice.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Faster, safer, lighter: you can't lose with the Grivel Speedy long ice screw, and you can't lose it either! Ready to go with a freely rotating shackle holding the 20cm Dyneema sling and Gamma carabiner, the possibility of dropping the screw before placing or after removal is virtually negated. Just clip it into the rope before placing and you're covered, then when it's safely back on your harness use the handy ring to keep the krab from dangling. The Speedy ice screw weighs 15% less than the equivalent screw/quickdraw combination and makes the whole placement process quicker and easier - a bonus on cascade ice.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Keep a group of up to ten people warm in case of an incident, or just to have lunch, in the Rab Group Shelter 8-10 Bothy. Lightweight windproof and waterproof polyester fabric traps air which is quickly warmed by the body heat of people sitting inside, creating a space much warmer than the outside and thus ideal for keeping a casualty or even the whole group warm while waiting for assistance. Simply shake out the whole bothy, duck underneath and sit on the waterproof seats around the bottom of the walls to keep it upright. If further support is needed, recesses in the roof take walking poles, while vents release excess vapour to prevent too much condensation forming inside. The bright colour and reflective piping keep you as visible as possible, and there's a window at each end so occupants can keep an eye on the outside world. Essential kit for group leaders and groups of friends in the hills, mountains or anywhere that shelters are few and far between, the bothy is supplied with a drawstring stuffsack for compactness and, weighing considerably less than a kilogram, is about the lightest of its type and size available.]]></description>

The two Easy Rider carabiners have hot-forged bodies, gates and triggers with ergonomically contoured shapes for easy clip/unclip action and comfort.

The Energy Absorption System (EAS) is stored in a durable, zippered pouch and is constructed using a compact, internal-sewn webbing system with a patent-pending sew construction. The two lanyards have internal elastic for a tangle-free design and are individually sewn into the EAS.]]></description>

Tough enough for serious conditions and heavy use, the clever, nesting design keeps packspace to a minimum, particularly as the lid can double as a plate. This versatile set is optimised for efficiency, making it ideal for guides and frequent travellers who want to cook a lot of wide-ranging but straightforward meals during all sorts of trips. Three pans with fitting lids and a lightweight, interchangeable handle nest together, with MSR Alpine Plates and Bowls if you prefer. So if reliability trumps super-low weight in your book, the Alpine 4 Pot Set is the cook kit for your group.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Quick 2 System is the efficient cookware set for a pair of travellers - just add cutlery and you've all the gear for a simple meal. Two pans, two insulated mugs, two high-walled plates and a sturdy lid all pack together in one compact package, giving you the possibility of cooking basic meals on any trip. The set is particularly suited to use with the MSR WhisperLite and SuperFly series of stoves, since the hard-anodised aluminium pans spread the heat for fewer burnt bits in your pasta. The smaller pan is also non-stick for cooking sauces, veg etc. It's also easy to manipulate the pans around your workspace thanks to the Talon handle that clips securely but transfers easily between them. When packing, it also holds the lid of the large pan firmly on to avoid those annoying rattles. Smart design to make trail life better - the Quick 2 System adds versatility to your lightweight camp cooking.]]></description>

Smart design to make trail life better - the Quick 2 System adds versatility to your lightweight camp cooking.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Base 2 Pot Set is the economical option for versatile two-person cooking on the trail, with two non-stick pans, lid and Talon handle. Lightweight aluminium keeps the weight down and the simple, straight-walled design lets the pans nest snugly together with the aluminium lid on top.

Plus you get an ultralight PackTowl that sits between the pans to prevent scratching. It's the epitome of simple efficiency that can be built up into your perfect set with MSR DeepDish plates and insulated mugs. Choose the Base 2 Pot Set to keep versatile cooking within your weight and price budgets.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Titan 2 Pot Set makes the average lightweight pan  set feel like it needs to lose weight, but is great for simple cooking for two. A nesting pair of ultra-lightweight titanium pans is the lightest way to equip yourself for cooking. With 2.5 litres capacity between them, plus a lightweight handle and a lid that doubles as a plate, you have all the cookware you need for a boil-only meal for two. And at only 272g there's no reason not to give yourself that option.]]></description>

Its fast-acting, deeply penetrative ingredients add water repellency, reduce water absorption and maintain breathability. It also revives the appearance of leather, maintains its suppleness and even adds to or enhances the shine.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[NEW EDITION: A guide to a backpacking tour of the Queyras region of the Haute Alps on the border between Italy and France, following the GR58 and GR541 trails. The route includes the highest point reached on any grand randone with 24 cols above 2000m and options to climb up to 17 summits, five above 3000m.The Queyras is a dramatic, unspoilt region in the shadow of Monte Viso, sheltered to the west by the crins, and is one of the sunniest areas of the Alps. The absence of glaciers makes ideal hillwalking country, with several high mountain summits accessible to the ordinary walker and scrambler and it's one of France's best kept secrets!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Totally redesigned for 2009, the ever popular Belay Master continues to set standards for safety and design. The Belay Master is a tweaked version of the Fat Boy HMS with a patented integral plastic clip that together increase the safety of the belay system. The clip can only be locked into place when the screw gate barrel is tightened into the locked position, thus providing a fail-safe check that the biner is closed securely. The plastic clip also stops the carabiner from rotating in the belay system and being cross loaded. The Belay Master is a mid-size HMS with a large rope radius and soft angles on the top bar. This means that it works well with the vast majority of belay devices.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Alpine 1-Litre TeaPot nests inside 1.5 litre MSR pans, enabling those much-needed cups of tea wherever you go. Straight-sided for easy-packing efficiency, the big lid makes boiling water or even simple cooking quick and simple, not to mention the easy cleaning. The Alpine TeaPot also has a small but serviceable spout, making sure your drink ends up in your cup and not on the ground or, worse still, your hand. Plus foldaway handles on top allow quick and confident movement even when the pot is full. It's also useful for cooking porridge and heating wet meals efficiently when carried alone. Classic style that just works in all conditions, the Alpine TeaPot is reliably efficient wherever you are.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[If you like the Helium quickdraw but not the price, the Wild Country Nitro Quick Draw is for you. The crabs are essentially the same as the Helium, but with a nose design that is less costly to produce. You therefore get the quality and low weight of the Helium quickdraw, with excellent value for money. I-beam construction keeps the weight amazingly low for a full-sized biner and the hooded nose helps prevent unwanted unclipping. Linked by 10mm Dyneema tape and with a Wild Country Tadpole O-ring to keep the clipping end the right way round, this is a one quickdraw to take everywhere - it performs well on sport, trad and winter routes.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[An MSR TightLine Cord Tensioner reduces sagging and keeps the guys in the ground during wind plus it can be used with virtually any tent. Simply described, it's a guyline bungy, a shock-absorbing silicone band that attaches between the guyline and the tent so that when a big gust hits the impact on the peg is reduced. Simple and effective, it also assists with maintaining the ventilation gap between the inner and outer tents; vital for limiting condensation through the night. Pitch your tent with the TightLine and it will keep the tension on the fabric constant through the inevitable changes in temperature and humidity, so you'll always come back to a tent that's pitched as well as you left it.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Extreme cooking is made easier with the MSR Reactor 1.0L Stove System, designed for the remote and challenging conditions met by expeditionists. Ideal for soloists and pairs on a weight budget, the new one litre configuration provides all the excellent performance of its bigger brothers in a package as lightweight and compact as possible. Since the radiant burner head sits almost inside the base of the pot for cooking it is protected from the wind, a very high proportion of the heat goes into warming your food or melting snow - it boils half a litre of water in only 90 seconds! The litre pot can take the burner head and a 100 gram gas canister for transport and the burner is compatible with all sizes of Reactor pot giving you the flexibility for different types of trip. The proven best stove for the real world, choose a Reactor to eat quicker when it's cold.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[THE ultimate camp bed, the Thermarest LuxuryLite UltraLite Cot is not only lighter and smaller-packing than any other, it's also a better sleep experience! The words camp and bed usually summon memories of squeaks, rattles, breakage and being tipped on to the floor, but this revolutionary new design makes sleeping off the floor a brand new game of cards. From the tiny package only 41cm long, a few practised moves and you're ready to be warm, comfortable and stable all night after a long day doing what you love.Instead of heavy steel poles and braces, the LuxuryLite Cot raises the game with lightweight alloy edge poles and cross-poles, secured with super-smart, super-robust and super-durable nylon feet that minimise damage to a tent floor and support the edges so you can even sit on the side without the whole thing bucking you off; you don't have to be circumspect when lying down! Plus, in case the remarkably low packed weight is still too much for a lightweight trip, you can strip it to a minimal setup that only weighs 900 grams but still provides excellent sleeping comfort! For paramount cushioning and extra warmth on a glamping or family camping trip team it with a Thermarest mattress, or simply enjoy the supportive comfort of a camp bed without the disadvantages.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest NeoAir Dream Large is as versatile as a mattress can be, going from compact storage to generous comfort in moments with minimal effort. Following the huge success of the DreamTime mattress, Therm-A-Rest have evolved the design to be even more useful, so there's no longer an issue with storage. Inside the fleecy cover, under the open cell foam top layer, is a custom-made NeoAir mattress, which deflates easily and completely by rolling the mattress. It's also simple to inflate as the storage sack can be used to push air into the mattress - it's as full as you need after only a few bagfuls. Tougher than the fast and light NeoAir mattresses for durability, the base can be used without the foam and cover for a convenient, even smaller package on a lightweight trip. All the pieces together are a full 10 cm thick, which is so comfortable and insulating as to make you forget you're lying on a hard floor or rocky ground. Then all you need is a great tent and you're fixed for outdoor adventures in luxury!]]></description>

Following the huge success of the DreamTime mattress, Therm-A-Rest have evolved the design to be even more useful, so there's no longer an issue with storage.

Tougher than the fast and light NeoAir mattresses for durability, the base can nevertheless be used without the foam and cover for a convenient, even smaller package on a lightweight trip.

Then all you need is a great tent and you're fixed for outdoor adventures in luxury!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[All the comfort and warmth of the DreamTime in a smaller package - Therm-A-Rest's NeoAir Dream XLarge is as versatile as a mattress can be. Following the huge success of the DreamTime mattress, Therm-A-Rest have evolved the design to be even more useful, so there's no longer an issue with storage. Inside the fleecy cover, under the open cell foam top layer, is a custom-made, extra-wide NeoAir inflatable pad, which deflates easily and completely by rolling the mattress. It's also simple to inflate as the storage sack can be used to push air into the mattress - it's as full as you need after only a few bagfuls. Tougher than the fast and light NeoAir mattresses for durability, the base can nevertheless be used without the foam and cover for a convenient, even smaller package on a lightweight trip. Choose the XLarge size for and extra 13 cm of space to turn over, or just to spread out in your sleep. All the pieces together are a full 10 cm thick; it's so comfortable and insulating as to make you forget you're lying on a hard floor or rocky ground. Then all you need is a great tent and you're fixed for outdoor adventures in luxury!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[So big it needs an over-sized valve to deflate and so comfy you'll barely believe it, Therm-A-Rest's Mondo King Large is the biggest and best self-inflating mat ever. Inside the soft fabric cover is a ten centimetre-thick pad of ultra-responsive foam, just waiting for you to sink into its depths and enjoy the contour-hugging support as you drift off to sleep. Nearly as wide as half a double bed and long enough for most sleepers to have warm feet all night, you'll have room to starfish (as much as you can in a sleeping bag anyway) and shift position in the night without falling off the edge. That's when it's inflated - open the valve, roll from the other end and you'll be amazed how small and light it packs. Rugged on the bottom to help prevent punctures and self-inflating in around fifteen minutes just by the power of the foam expanding, the Mondo King is ideal for base camp and family holidays where packsize is as important as comfort.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Specially designed to work with the new compacting poles, the Black Diamond Ultra Mountain Z-Pole Basket prevents the poles sinking into snow when walking. With two cut-outs to clip round the folded sections, the Z-Pole basket not only facilitates compact folding even when it's attached, but also keeps them folded when the poles are in your pack. Then when you get to a gradient, whip your poles out and the basket will keep your tips from sinking fathoms deep into snow or soft ground. A smart solution that works in all ways, the Ultra Mountain Z-Pole Basket makes your Ultra Mountain poles even better.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Imagine an HMS krab that autolocks infallibly, is easy to open but light and compact; imagine no more, the Black Diamond Magnetron RockLock is here. Even lighter than the equivalent twistlock, and significantly more intuitive to open, this super-secure carabiner makes setting up your belay device quicker and removes the risk of leaving the gate unlocked. Simply press the pivoted arms on either side of the gate to raise the magnets and the gate will open smoothly, with the subtly curved spine maximising the size of the opening. Release it, and the magnets click back into place with the steel insert on the snag-free keylock nose. With a square hinge end to hold the belay loop secure, the RockLock is your ideal belay carabiner at the wall and on the mountain.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[All the cookware for two in a compact package, the MSR Trail Lite Duo System enables you to feel that bit more at home even when space is at a premium. Nestled snugly inside the two litre aluminium pot come bowls and insulated mugs enough for a pair of backpackers to eat and drink in a civilised manner however long the trip. The hard-anodised aluminium and ceramic non-stick surface inside the pot protect it when cooking and packing and with a clear strainer lid you can see exactly when your water's boiling and thus save fuel. It's also very secure once packed, since the folding handle clips across the lid and the contents are snug inside to avoid annoying rattles as you walk. MSR's DeepDish bowls and lightweight double-wall mugs complete this versatile ensemble to add a bit of convenience to life on the trail.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Undoubtedly the world's most famous ski traverse, the Haute Route takes skiers through the most prestigious ranges of the Alps, crossing the glaciers and high passes between Chamonix (F) and Zermatt(CH). Every year, around 4000 skiers undertake this unforgettable one-week traverse between the mountaineering capitals of the Alps.The introductory sections provide a wealth of practical advice on preparation, strategy and equipment, plus expert tips and a brief history of the traverse, all of which serve to highlight the alpine dimension of the Haute Route. Each stage is then presented in detail through comprehensive route descriptions, profiles of the climbs and descents, sketch maps and photos showing the route to follow.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[In the only book to tell the real story of Everest 1953, Mick Conefrey reveals that what has gone down in history as a supremely well-planned attempt was in fact beset by crises ? both on and off the mountain. To succeed, team leader Colonel John Hunt and his team had to draw on unimaginable skill and determination, as well as sheer British ingenuity.Everest 1953 is not only a gripping true story of courage and adventure, but a long-overdue tribute to an under-appreciated British triumph. Revealing the answers to long-enduring controversies ? did Tenzing or Hillary actually reach the top first? ? and exploring the legacy of this great ascent, it is the perfect way to commemorate the year of the London Olympics.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[To go fast you've got to go light and the Therm-A-Rest Prolite Small Mattress makes this easy while keeping you comfortable and your body warm. It's made from materials selected for packability and light weight, but you'd be wrong to think that it's all about the carry as 2.5cm of high-quality foam is more than enough for a good night's sleep for practical types. Minimalist campers and backpackers, who do everything they can to shave weight, will appreciate the comfort and insulation that the XSmall size offers at such low weight.It's the precision cut-outs in the foam that make the Prolite the lightest and most compact mattress available without impacting on comfort. Shaped for longevity, the holes shave out the maximum possible weight while maintaining the support and insulation needed for three-season trips. The extra small size is perfect when you don't mind having your head and feet on your pack, your rope or your jacket in order to carry less. This means your shoulders and pelvis, the parts exerting the most pressure, are well-cushioned and insulated but you don't have the extra weight of the rest of it. Further aided by the tapered, rounded shape, the Prolite Small tips the balance at 230 grams and rolls down to only 8 cm diameter yet has enough warmth and comfort for all but winter conditions. For a quiet night's sleep after a long day on the trail, you won't find a smaller, lighter mattress than the Prolite XSmall for the warmth.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest Trekker Lounge Kit 20 converts a 51cm wide Thermarest mattress into a comfortable recliner chair but packs small for a rucksack. Ideal for longer trips, base camp and family camping, this convenient and lightweight seating option fits easily over a rectangular Medium or Regular Thermarest mattress.  This gives you the option to recline with your legs supported or sit more upright for cooking, eating etc. And when it finally gets to bedtime, simply unclip the sides, slip your pillow under the sleeve and it's ready for a comfy night's sleep. Home comforts that travel with you, the Thermarest Trekker Lounge makes camp life that bit more luxurious.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest Luxury Map Regular mattress is a one-piece self-inflating mat made for sumptuous comfort, but it rolls up tight for transport too. Advanced pressure-mapping is the key to the LuxuryMap's loving embrace, providing cushioning and support exactly where you need it. That means that even women's hips and men's shoulders can sink into the die-cut areas, while the rest of the body is supported by the full-density foam everywhere else. Perfect for family- and car-camping,the soft face fabric won't irritate if your sleeping bag slips. And the whole thing rolls down to a convenient size to slot into your car boot. Ideal for frequent or occasional use under canvas, you'll discover new levels of camping comfort with the Thermarest Luxury Map.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Reactor 2.5L Pot adds capacity to your Reactor Stove System, extending its use to group situations. Easy to stir and with enough space to boil water for up to five dry meals at once, it also melts ice and snow without batting an eyelid. The large pot accommodates the Reactor's radiant burner head and a 227g canister inside for efficient transportation. The key to the Reactor system is the base of the pot, that accepts the burner head for minimal waste heat and maximum stability. The Reactor 2.5L pot brings this excellent performance to a versatile capacity, so you can take full reliability on an extreme group trip.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Extreme cooking is made easier with the MSR Reactor 1.7L Stove System, designed for the remote and challenging conditions met by expeditionists. Ideal for varied use by soloists and groups of up to three people, the 1.7L pot strikes a balance between capacity and compactness, though of course you can add extra pots for more options.Since the radiant burner head sits almost inside the base of the pot for cooking it is protected from the wind, a very high proportion of the heat goes into warming your food or melting snow - it takes around three minutes to boil a litre of water in almost any conditions! The burner head and gas canister store inside the pot for transport and the burner is compatible with all sizes of Reactor pot giving you the flexibility for different types of trip. The proven best stove system for the real world, choose a Reactor to eat quicker when it's cold.]]></description>

You'll be frankly amazed at the speed and simplicity of pitching this sturdy backpacking tent, with MSR's unique hub design making assembly as easy as joining the dots. With the poles up, you have several pitching options: three-season protection with the inner tent; Fast and Light pitching with just the flysheet and footprint (available separately); or the inner tent alone in bug-ridden heat. And all enjoy excellent space and ventilation from MSR's excellent design. In every three-season situation, the Hubba HP gives you the protection you need at lowest practical weight.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[A lighter, improved version of the original I-Beam krab; the DMM Spectre 2 has tweaks in all the right places: the only trad biner you'll ever need. The I-beam construction allows this 32g carabiner to amazingly hold 9kN with the gate open; an improved, deeper rope basket directs the load to the strongest point during a fall; and the shrouded nose reduces the chance of the gate opening when you really don't want it to. Ok, the DMM Phantom is lighter, but the Spectre works all year round - it's large enough to handle well even in winter gloves. If you count the grams but won't skimp on safety, you'll be more than satisfied with the Spectre 2.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Inflate any Therm-A-Rest NeoAir mattress in just three minutes and with minimal effort; the NeoAir Mini Pump is so light it can go almost anywhere. Even with 2 AAA batteries, the pump only weighs 65 grams and being small enough to pack in the end of your mattress storage bag, it won't be an inconvenience in your pack either. On reaching camp, simply flip the end of the casing, fit the rubber nozzle over the mattress valve and switch on for a perfectly inflated mattress in three minutes. At altitude this can be a huge saving of effort and in cold conditions prevents large amounts of water vapour in your breath from sitting inside your mattress.

<description><![CDATA[Inflate any Therm-A-Rest NeoAir mattress in just three minutes and with minimal effort; the NeoAir Mini Pump is so light it can go almost anywhere. Even with 2 AAA batteries, the pump only weighs 65 grams and being small enough to pack in the end of your mattress storage bag, it won't be an inconvenience in your pack either. On reaching camp, simply flip the end of the casing, fit the rubber nozzle over the mattress valve and switch on for a perfectly inflated mattress in three minutes. At altitude this can be a huge saving of effort and in cold conditions prevents large amounts of water vapour in your breath from sitting inside your mattress. Possibly the most essential gadget for Kilimanjaro or other long, cold treks at altitude.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Lightwave G20 Footprint offers extra protection for your inner tent groundsheet from wet, mud and sharps on the ground. Lying beneath the inner tent, the 90 denier nylon taffeta adds enough extra durability and waterproofing to let you sleep soundly knowing you're not going to wake up in a puddle. Lightweight and compact in your pack, the footprint also makes striking camp easier as there's no need to get mud everywhere when rolling up the inner. Your tent will thank you for it too, since a footprint improves longevity. A small investment that could save a big expense, you'll feel better pitching your tent on its specifically-shaped footprint.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Black Diamond Z-Pole Baskets are replacement parts for any of the Black Diamond folding Z-Pole series of trekking poles. If the original ends finally wear out or have seen better days, it's easy to replace them: simply remove the old with the aid of hot water, push on the new and you're ready to be off again. The Z-Pole basket is an unobtrusive way to stop your pole tips sinking too far into soft ground. They also have an interchangeable tip, with rubber for quieter progress on rock and tarmac as well as carbide tips for durable grip in gravel and compact earth. A useful spare for an extended trip. Supplied as a pair.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Black Diamond Z-Pole Baskets are replacement parts for any of the Black Diamond folding Z-Pole series of trekking poles. If the original ends finally wear out or have seen better days, it's easy to replace them: simply remove the old with the aid of hot water, push on the new and you're ready to be off again. The Z-Pole basket is an unobtrusive way to stop your pole tips sinking too far into soft ground. They also have an interchangeable tip, with rubber for quieter progress on rock and tarmac as well as carbide tips for durable grip in gravel and compact earth. A useful spare for an extended trip. Supplied as a pair.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Grivel G10 Wide New Classic is an evolution of the classic walking crampon, with a modified front designed to fit even snowboard and telemark boots. G10s are light-weight, universal 10 point crampons with flexible linking bars, designed to meet the demands of winter walkers and the occasional snow gully. Both front and rear plastic harnesses are hinged from their respective retention posts and may be 'opened' to facilitate easy attachment to the boot, then closed securely once the boot is inside. The single strap closure system is so simple there's little need to include instructions. The New Classic is therefore ideal for rental programs and first time users. This system is simple and reliable, quick and easy, but it does take up a bit more space in the rucksack than auto and semi-automatic bindings. If you need to fit your crampons on to over-sized boots, you need the Grivel G10 Wide.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Grivel Eccles 28 Women's Pack is a straightforward performer of a daypack that will excel on mountains year round. Like the popular men's version, this eco-consciously produced climbing pack is lightweight at 1.19kg, but that doesn't stop it being exceptionally comfortable and rugged for long, hard trips. In fact the light, accommodating and highly breathable women's harness keeps the pack close to your back so you remain stable and unrestricted whatever you're carrying in whichever direction. Skis, poles, axes, helmet, rope and more can be securely attached to the outside, with a side zip offering easy access to the well-shaped interior. Eco-friendly doesn't have to mean basic - the Women's Eccles 28 takes practical comfort to a new level.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Explorer Alti Arc Sunglasses by Julbo are designed to protect your eyes in the extremest of conditions. They provide maximum protection from the sun and the frames are light and robust (for storage in a rucksack), adjustable and ergonomic (adjustable temples, ventilation to eliminate perspiration, easy to adjust while wearing gloves). The lenses will perfectly reproduce contours and adapt to lighting conditions for maximum visual comfort. Whilst fantastic in high altitudes in reducing the glare and UV reflection from snow and ice, we have used these in the desert with the same result. In fact we were caught in a very harsh sand storm and not speck of dust or sand got in the eyes! Making them great for all conditions.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Explorer Alti Arc Sunglasses by Julbo are designed to protect your eyes in the extremest of conditions. They provide maximum protection from the sun and the frames are light and robust (for storage in a rucksack), adjustable and ergonomic (adjustable temples, ventilation to eliminate perspiration, easy to adjust while wearing gloves). The lenses will perfectly reproduce contours and adapt to lighting conditions for maximum visual comfort. Whilst fantastic in high altitudes in reducing the glare and UV reflection from snow and ice, we have used these in the desert with the same result. In fact we were caught in a very harsh sand storm and not speck of dust or sand got in the eyes! Making them great for all conditions.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Reactor 1.0L Pot adds versatility to your Reactor Stove System, ideal for lightweight trips and solo endeavours in serious conditions. Smaller and lighter, but it still accommodates the radiant burner head and a 100 gram canister inside. So all your cooking equipment stays together and compact in your minimal winter pack. The key to the Reactor system is the base of the pot, that accepts the burner head for minimal waste heat and maximum stability. The Reactor 1.0L pot brings this excellent performance to smaller capacity, so you can take full reliability on your lighter trips too.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[You need The Tick Key if you're ever outdoors; the quickest, easiest and safest way to remove a tick from people or pets to keep outdoor activities safe. Whatever you're doing outside, whether backpacking or approaching the crag, walking the dog or exploring a woodland, the ever-increasing risk of tick-borne disease is a gathering cloud thanks to milder winters. The crafty little things lie in wait on plants like grass and bracken and attach themselves to hair or clothing, crawling around until they find a nice spot for a meal. Though many bites are little more than a minor irritation, it's never pleasant to be sucked on by a small creature. Add to this the growing possibility of Lyme disease or any of several other unpleasant diseases, removing an attached tick as fast and in as low-risk manner as possible has to be the top priority when one is discovered.Enter The Tick Key. Small and flat to be unobtrusive on your keys or in your wallet, this remarkable one-piece device is every tick's nightmare. Simply place with the tick in the hole, slide the tick into the slot, pull and the whole tick is removed. That's the whole tick, mouthparts, body, legs and everything. It doesn't even give the little nasty a chance to infect the wound with its stomach contents. And you can retain the tick to show doctors in the case of a later reaction. Working equally well on dogs and cats as on humans it can also be attached to a pet's collar or your backpack so you don't need to remember it every time. As convenient as it is efficient and effective, The Tick Key is a small investment that could literally save a life.Please note: there are six different coloured anodised finishes. Orders for Tick Keys will be given a colour randomly unless you specify otherwise in the special delivery instruction box during the checkout process.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Nalgene Wide Mouth Cantene 1.0 litre offers all the benefits of a wide mouth bottle without taking up all that space when it's empty. The flexible container is easy to fill, easy to clean, easy to pack and above all, easy to drink from, keeping your liquids where you want them and tasting as they should. It even stands upright when it's full, thanks to the gusseted base. The wide mouth opening is welded into the top in such a way that, like the screw-top, it's guaranteed leak-proof. So the Cantene is just as reliable as the Everyday bottles, but more convenient.Nalgene's reason for the name:Convenient Nalgene Loop-top Closure.Available in different sizes up to 3 litres.Narrow- and Wide-mouth options available.Takes most water filters.Easy storage and collapsibility.Nice bottom gusset for standing upright.EEasy to read 'fill line' indicator.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The 3+ is a three-antenna device with a special extra function to first enhance your own safety. The intelligent position recognition system analyses the position of the antennas and automatically switches to the optimal transmitting antenna. There is no longer any such thing as the 'worst position'.The circular display lets you focus on the essentials. The distance to and the relative position of a victim. Always align the device to the arrow. The solid arrow and the central distance value keep you going in the right direction.The patented circular display shows you at a glance whether you are getting closer to the signal or moving away from it. With the precise distance value you can very effectively determine the distance to the buried victim and limit the area to be probed.The 3+ allows you to maintain an overview even with multiple burials. The number of victims is shown in the display. As soon as you have found the first one you can blend out their signal with the pin key. The victim is displayed as pinned and you can immediately continue with your search. Smart antenna technology enhances your own safety. Signal separation with pinning function. Very easy operation due to: clear control elements, precise real time display with directional arrows and circular display. Rubberized housing for protection and ergonomics. Display lighting for night searches, switchover in case of a follow-up avalanche, clear and optimized search acoustics, updateability.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Possibly the ultimate packable travel daypack, the Ticket to the Moon Mini Backpack weighs just 90 grams but carries an amazing 15kg! Of course, you'll probably never have to load it up that much, but the 15 litre capacity is more than enough for a lightweight waterproof, your lunch and other essentials for a good day out. Just the thing for backpackers, expeditionists and families on a weight budget.So how is it so light? Well, that would be the synthetic parachute nylon, the same as is used for the Ticket to the Moon Parachute Hammocks. This super-tough but extremely soft and light material also allows the Mini Backpack to scrunch down to a tiny size for packing. Triple-stitched for surprising strength and with an easy-opening zip-around lid, it's very useable and practical too. And it comes in a range of funky colours - call us if you want to choose. Functionality at outrageously low weight - the Ticket to the Moon Mini Backpack is the way forward when grams count.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Introducing Peebol, the pocket-sized toilet that lets you 'go' anywhere. No, really! This is a genuine alternative to getting out of your sleeping bag during a freezing cold night in a tent. It works even better than a bottle, because the granules inside absorb liquid and change into a spill-proof biodegradable gel in seconds. You can even reuse them until full thanks to the watertight seal and 1 litre capacity. Then in the morning, just dispose of with the rest of your rubbish or keep it safely (and odour-free) in your pack pocket until you get back to civilisation.Peebol is made for both women and men. Ladies, use on its own or aim using a Shewee. They're also ideal for keeping in the car for emergencies like traffic jams or to avoid using service stations late at night. And it's hard to describe just how useful they are for children on car journeys. Compact and discreet enough for a daypack, handbag, pocket or first aid kit, you can take a Peebol literally anywhere and never be caught short again.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Introducing Peebol, the pocket-sized toilet that lets you 'go' anywhere. No, really! This is a genuine alternative to getting out of your sleeping bag during a freezing cold night in a tent. It works even better than a bottle, because the granules inside absorb liquid and change into a spill-proof biodegradable gel in seconds. You can even reuse them until full thanks to the watertight seal and 1 litre capacity. Then in the morning, just dispose of with the rest of your rubbish or keep it safely (and odour-free) in your pack pocket until you get back to civilisation.Peebol is made for both women and men. Ladies, use on its own or aim using a Shewee. They're also ideal for keeping in the car for emergencies like traffic jams or to avoid using service stations late at night. And it's hard to describe just how useful they are for children on car journeys. Compact and discreet enough for a daypack, handbag, pocket or first aid kit, you can take a Peebol literally anywhere and never be caught short again.]]></description>

As colourful as your experience, the SEO3 uses three high-quality, bright LEDs to illuminate your world. Whether you're camping, running, night-walking or anything else, the SEO3's rotating head means it always has the perfect angle for what you're doing.It also sports a glare-free red LED, so you can keep your night vision even after reading your map. Plus it won't come on in your pack thanks to the keylock switch. At 96g and with a comfortable, adjustable and washable strap, you'll be happy to wear the SEO3 all night long when needed. Especially as it has a whopping beam distance of 40 metres - more than enough to keep you secure and active on the trail, on your bike or anywhere.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The LED Lenser SEO7R offers massive lighting performance in an eco-friendly rechargeable form that also keeps the weight amazingly low. Using the LED Lenser Advanced Focus System of a reflector and a lens, the SEO7R has a maximum luminosity of 220 lumens, but can still be used comfortably for ambient lighting (most headtorches have only a reflector, so can't focus the beam as effectively. Oh, and almost incidentally, the beam adapts to what you're looking at, switching from an ambient mode for reading the map to a brighter mode when you look into the distance. That's Optisense Technology for you!The rotating head lets you direct the beam wherever you want it too - whether ahead when cycling or in front of your feet on a night walk. It even starts at a decent angle - pointing slightly downwards. And with the continuous dimming that comes back on at the setting last used, you can customise your lighting to optimise power usage. All this, and it still only weighs 93 grams - plenty light enough for comfortable extended wear. Major power that's light and practical - that's the LED Lenser SEO7R.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[You can take the Terra Nova Ultra Hyperspace literally anywhere - from the poles to the highest peaks, it provides full protection at fantastically low weight. Shelters three hard-pushing expeditionists on a challenge one week, then a small family on the coast the next - this is a tent for all seasons and all trips, a sturdy, dry haven for the end of every day.In the same configuration as the long-established Terra Nova Hyperspace, this high-performance four-season tent uses materials with even higher strength-to-weight ratios. That means it weighs 25 percent less, while still providing full-on protection - very impressive! In fact, it's Terra Nova's lightest three-person mountain tent. However, it's not limited to cold conditions - pitch the inner only in hot, muggy weather for total ventilation without bugs. Space, practicality and two doors with vestibules; if you need your tent to be as versatile as you, the Ultra Hyperspace is where you want to be.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[You can take the Terra Nova Ultra Hyperspace literally anywhere - from the poles to the highest peaks, it provides full protection at fantastically low weight. Shelters three hard-pushing expeditionists on a challenge one week, then a small family on the coast the next - this is a tent for all seasons and all trips, a sturdy, dry haven for the end of every day.In the same configuration as the long-established Terra Nova Hyperspace, this high-performance four-season tent uses materials with even higher strength-to-weight ratios. That means it weighs 25 percent less, while still providing full-on protection - very impressive! In fact, it's Terra Nova's lightest three-person mountain tent. However, it's not limited to cold conditions - pitch the inner only in hot, muggy weather for total ventilation without bugs. Space, practicality and two doors with vestibules; if you need your tent to be as versatile as you, the Ultra Hyperspace is where you want to be.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Terra Nova Superlite Bothy 2 keeps you and your buddy covered in an emergency, but it's barely noticeable the rest of the time. That's because Terra Nova have used extremely lightweight (though still ruggedly tough) siliconised fabric - the same as in their super-lightweight tents - that packs down small and weighs remarkably little.They've also cut out anything that's not absolutely necessary to shave off even more weight. So the Superlite Bothy doesn't have windows or sockets for placing your poles to support the roof. What it does have is true waterproof and windproof protection, so if you get caught out or just need somewhere warm to have a rest, you'll be shielded and visible in the Superlite Bothy 2.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Black Diamond Pole Spares Kit has virtually everything you could possibly need to tune up a ravaged set of trekking poles. In fact the only parts it doesn't have are replacement sections and handles, but if you've lost those you're going to need a new set of poles anyway!Everything else is there - pins and plugs to wristloops, tips and baskets for pretty much any BD pole in existence. Much of it would also fit poles of other brands, assuming similar sizes and fittings. It's all packed into a robust and portable organiser box and small parts are bagged in their own compartments inside. This makes it ideal for mountain leaders and tour companies who loan out ski or trekking poles or who frequently find themselves mending those of their customers. But equally, it's something that support crews on big and remote challenges shouldn't be without. Simply chuck the whole thing in with the poles and you're covered for all those little mishaps that just happen along the way.Contents2 x Powder Basket2 x Freeride Basket2 x Compact Powder Basket2 x 3/4 Basket2 x Trekking Basket14 x Wrist Strap to fit most BD Ski and Trekking poles from 200512 x FlickLock to fit diameters 13.4-18mm plus elliptic poles2 x Z-Pole Basket4 x interchangeable carbide and rubber tips for Z-Pole Baskets4 x Long and Short Flex Tips8 x Friction Plugs for probe polesAssorted strap pins, strap screws and FlickLock screws.3 x Basket Ferrule]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Exped MegaMat 7.5 LXW was made to prove that you don't need to be in a house to have a comfortable night's sleep. Amazingly light and compact for the weight, the MegaMat is perfect for car camping, house guests, glamping, base camp and much more. In fact in any sleeping situation that doesn't require carrying your gear on your back the MegaMat's wall-to-wall cushioned comfort and support will amaze and delight even the most hardened camping cynic.This self-inflating mat is 7.5 cm thick and is designed with 3 dimensional sidewalls, which ensure that the maximum thickness is carried from edge to edge. This also allows the mats to be placed side by side without a gap, making what is essentially a double bed. Furry tricot fabric on top is comfy next to the skin and the open-cell foam inside is cored horizontally so the whole thing packs down to only 21cm diameter. If you want the ultimate in convenient camping comfort without filling your car with mattress, th Exped MegaMat 7.5 LXW is definitely the sleeping mat for you.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest LuxuryLite UltraLite Cot Large is not only lighter and smaller-packing than any other camp bed, it's also a better sleep experience! The words camp and bed usually summon memories of squeaks, rattles, breakage and being tipped on to the floor, but this revolutionary new design makes sleeping off the floor a brand new game of cards. For a start, this Large version adds extra length and width for taller sleepers to avoid the dreaded overhang. From the tiny package only 43cm long, a few practised moves and you're ready to be warm, comfortable and stable all night after a long day doing what you love.Instead of heavy steel poles and braces, the LuxuryLite Cot raises the game with lightweight alloy edge poles and cross-poles, secured with super-smart, super-robust and super-durable nylon feet that minimise damage to a tent floor and support the edges so you can even sit on the side without the whole thing bucking you off; you don't have to be circumspect when lying down! Plus, in case the remarkably low packed weight is still too much for a lightweight trip, you can strip it to a minimal setup that only weighs just over a kilo but still provides excellent sleeping comfort! For paramount cushioning and extra warmth on a glamping or family camping trip team it with a Thermarest mattress, or simply enjoy the supportive comfort of a camp bed without the disadvantages.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[A mat for all seasons; the Thermarest NeoAir All Season Regular mattress features the award-winning NeoAir design with extra warmth and toughness. It's the most versatile of the NeoAir range, made for hard use all year round but still light and compact enough for lightweight backpacking. Now supplied with a NeoAir Mini Pump for simple and quick inflation, the Triangular Core Matrix is highly effective in recycling and reflecting your body heat when you're camping on cold ground as well as providing a resilient and supportive pad that hips and shoulders can sink into. With an R-value of 4.9 you'll be cosy well down into the minus figures and tough fabric on the upper and lower surfaces ensures that you can rely on the NeoAir All Seasons to keep you warm on every trip.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The redesigned Thermarest NeoAir Trekker Large Torso Mattress  is a robust, three-season sleeping pad for trips requiring high performance, durable gear. The addition of ThermaCapture technology gives this iteration a considerable advantage over its predecessor, boosting warmth while actually saving weight. But the NeoAir Trekker is still outstandingly durable, with tough, puncture-resistant fabrics top and bottom and that classic NeoAir construction. To save weight, the Large Torso size cushions your body only, leaving your feet and legs to rest on something like your pack or rope. The straightforward square shape gives you plenty of room to turn over, with 6.3cm of depth for your shoulders to sink into. If hard-wearing is one of your favourite words, the Thermarest NeoAir Trekker has to be your favourite camping mattress for all your three-season trips.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest Trail Pro Women's Regular Mattress is now even better for year-round use when backpacking, trekking or family camping. Now incorporating ultra-compressible, lightweight foam, the same foam as was used in the Thermarest 40th Anniversary Mattresses, the updated Trail Pro is lighter and more packable to go pretty much anywhere you go. The shape has also been tweaked, with straightened sides on the torso to facilitate gap-free mating of two mattresses. The Women's shape also has less foam cut out for a warmer sleeping surface. But you still get the support throughout that let your shoulders and hips sink in while suporting in between. A great all-rounder for a wide range of activities, the Trail Pro is Thermarest's warmest and most comfortable self-inflating mat.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[With the Thermarest Trail Lite Women's Regular mattress you can have your cake and eat it - a lightweight, packable mat with great sleeping comfort. A real all-rounder, now with an improved shape to avoid that annoying gap between a couple's mats. This version is a little smaller, warmer and more supportive in places to cater to a lady sleeper's needs. Die-cut foam is the secret to the Trail Lite's success, letting the mat pack to a compact 15cm diameter but still loft up to 3.8 cm thick. Small enough for your backpack but tough and comfy enough for family camping, this is a three-season winner for a variety of sleeping situations.]]></description>

This version is a little warmer and more supportive in places, with extra length over the Women's Regular size to cater to a taller lady sleeper's needs. Die-cut foam is the secret to the Trail Lite's success, letting the mat pack to a compact 15cm diameter but still loft up to 3.8 cm thick. Small enough for your backpack but tough and comfy enough for family camping, this is a three-season winner for a variety of sleeping situations.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Thermarest NeoAir Camper Regular is about the toughest and most comfortable air mattress you'll find that still packs down to a convenient size. 7.6cm thick and with durable, puncture-resistant fabric, you can feel the benefit of the NeoAir structure from the moment you lie down. That's because the double layer of interlocked triangles not only insulates you from losing heat to the ground, it also makes a comfortable and stable platform to sleep on. But it's still light and packs small enough to be a touch more luxury on an overnight or backpacking trip.

<description><![CDATA[To go fast you've got to go light, but that's no reason to be uncomfortable - the Therm-A-Rest Prolite Large Mattress gives the best of both worlds. It's made from materials selected for packability and light weight, but you'd be wrong to think that it's all about the carry as 2.5cm of high-quality foam is more than enough for a good night's sleep.It's the precision cut-outs in the foam that make the Prolite the lightest and most compact mattress available without impacting on comfort. Shaped for longevity, the holes shave out the maximum possible weight while maintaining the support and insulation needed for three-season trips. Further aided by the tapered, rounded shape, the Prolite Large packs down small but offers extra length and width for taller sleepers or those who prefer a bit more space. For a quiet night's sleep after a long day on the trail, you won't find a smaller, lighter mattress than the Prolite for the warmth.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[To go fast you've got to go light, but that's no reason to be uncomfortable - the Therm-A-Rest Prolite Large Mattress gives the best of both worlds. It's made from materials selected for packability and light weight, but you'd be wrong to think that it's all about the carry as 2.5cm of high-quality foam is more than enough for a good night's sleep.It's the precision cut-outs in the foam that make the Prolite the lightest and most compact mattress available without impacting on comfort. Shaped for longevity, the holes shave out the maximum possible weight while maintaining the support and insulation needed for three-season trips. Further aided by the tapered, rounded shape, the Prolite Large packs down small but offers extra length and width for taller sleepers or those who prefer a bit more space. For a quiet night's sleep after a long day on the trail, you won't find a smaller, lighter mattress than the Prolite for the warmth.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR SuperFly sits in the sweet spot for cooking on expedition; it's big enough to be controllable for cooking, but still packs small and light. It's not short on power either, boiling a litre of water in around three minutes. And it's extremely versatile thanks to the Multi-Mount fitting that allows the SuperFly to run on almost any self-sealing canister you'll find. Made to allow effective cooking of simple meals, the adjustable flame and wide burner head will make it possible to eat proper food on every trip. And the wide supports are great for large pots but twist away for packing. MSR's most versatile canister stove, the SuperFly makes eating easy on the trail.]]></description>

Designed for simple duties like boiling water, melting snow and heating simple meals in remote locations, the 2.4-litre pan holds plenty of water for two or three and will spread heat to help avoid burning. With a strong Talon handle and aluminium strainer lid it's designed to pack as easily as it handles. Plus there's plenty of space inside for MSR plates and bowls or a compact stove to keep everything together in one simple package. Great design at minimal weight, the Alpinist 2 Pot is the ideal option for fast and light trips.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Flex 3 System gives you the flexibility to cook like you do at home and eat in comfort and style - eating kit for three that packs brilliantly. Two decently-sized pans are hard-anodised for a durable, resilient finish, with a non-stick cooking surface in the smaller pan for sauces, vegetables and other potentially sticky foods. Packed neatly inside and between these are enough high-sided plates and stainless steel insulated mugs to keep a group of three eating in comfort throughout a long trip. They're even colour-coded, so everyone can have their own set. And the smart Talon handle locks the lid in place so you can rely on it staying together for transport. Customisable with extra mugs and plates and the MSR Flex Skillet, it's all the kit you need when decent food is the order of the day.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Flex 3 System gives you the flexibility to cook like you do at home and eat in comfort and style - eating kit for three that packs brilliantly. Two decently-sized pans are hard-anodised for a durable, resilient finish, with a non-stick cooking surface in the smaller pan for sauces, vegetables and other potentially sticky foods. Packed neatly inside and between these are enough high-sided plates and stainless steel insulated mugs to keep a group of three eating in comfort throughout a long trip. They're even colour-coded, so everyone can have their own set. And the smart Talon handle locks the lid in place so you can rely on it staying together for transport. Customisable with extra mugs and plates and the MSR Flex Skillet, it's all the kit you need when decent food is the order of the day.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[For group cooking and compact transport you need the MSR Flex 4 System, with all the pots and pans for four people to eat in style. Even elaborate meals are possible using this extensive system, which is made for road trips, group catering  and base-camping. Two hard-anodised aluminium pans, one with a hefty 5.3 litre capacity, give you plenty of options for cooking for up to four hungry hikers at the end of a long day. Serving is just as easy, with four colour-coded DeepDish Plates and Stainless Steel Insulated Mugs giving each person their own personalised set. The plates are particularly clever, with high walls that keep the food on the plate and off your lap. And at the end of the meal, it all nests together for secure transport. Smart cookware that makes trail life better both for cookers and eaters.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[With an MSR Heat Exchanger your food is ready quicker and takes less fuel to heat up. Attached easily and securely round an MSR 1.5- to 2-litre pan the corrugated fins both shield the flame from wind and transfer what would otherwise be wasted heat into your food. So it takes less time and less fuel to do the same amount of cooking, which can only be a good thing! Simple but effective, the Heat Exchanger makes a big difference on base- and car-camping trips.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR Pole Repair Kit is an important back-up for a long, remote trip, when an unuseable shelter can cause a whole world of trouble. Most standard backpacking tent poles can be shored up with the lightweight sleeve that simply slides into place. For other types, the adjustable splint makes a temporary repair to any pole of 7mm to 20mm diameter. Turn a mountain into a molehill if your tent pole fails - the MSR Pole Repair Kit offers peace of mind when shelter really counts.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[MSR Shelter Wash and Restore is your tent's key to a longer life, particularly if it's got a bit whiffy. Water-soluble, safe and easy to use, this two-part set gently cleans the fabrics then restores the Durable Water Repellent (DWR) coating on any tent. Simply dilute the Shelter Wash as directed, rub in with a sponge and rinse, then spray with Shelter Restore, rub in and leave to dry before packing. It's as easy as that to keep down musty smells from mildew or just from long use. If you've ever spent a night in a smelly tent you'll know just how useful MSR Shelter Wash and Restore can be!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR DromLite 4L Bag is the little sister of the seriously rugged Dromedary Bag; at 30 percent lower weight it's made for fast and light adventures. Stripped of everything except an eyelet for hanging and the handle that makes filling simple, the DromLite Bag is more streamlined and packs smaller. But it's still rugged, with 200 denier Cordura nylon fending off all comers. A straightforward, well-designed water carrier for when failure is not an option.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[When out on the backpacking trail you need the MSR SweetWater Microfilter to guard against contaminants in your drinking water.Effective against everything except viruses (which can be killed using chlorine-based treatments), so bacteria, protozoa, particulates and chemical contaminants don't stand a chance against the granulated activated carbon microfilter. The SweetWater is amazingly easy to pump but still packs down small and light for carrying. It also gets rid of taste and odour... it's in the name really! Clean it in the field to maintain the 1+ litre/min flow rate and pump straight into your drinking bottle for convenience. For the most reliable water possible, you can't do better than the SweetWater Purifier System.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The MSR AutoFlow Gravity Filter takes the effort out of cleaning your drinking water when base-camping in remote areas.Instead of pumping, simply hang the bag high to let gravity do the work of pushing water through the hollow fibre filter. Et voila, your water is free of bacteria, protozoa and particulates and can be put straight into your drinking bottle or reservoir using the universal adapter. The four-litre capacity and fast filtering makes the AutoFlow ideal for group use, plus the quick and easy tool-free cleaning is invaluable on long trips. Reliable water without the work, the AutoFlow Gravity Filter takes the effort out of safe hydration.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Platypus Platy Water Tank 6.0L holds all the water two people need around camp in an easy-to-carry, highly useable design. Despite it packing almost flat, the horizontal-style water carrier unzips at the top to take a massive six litres of water. Then you can use the carry handles to get it from source to wherever you want it and also to help with pouring from the screw top spout. Compatible with the Platypus GravityWorks filtration system, it's ideal for lightweight backpacking and base-camping alike and will see you through many an adventure at minimal weight.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Oh, the luxury of a glass of wine after a hard day's trekking; brought to you by the Platypus PlatyPreserve wine-carrying soft bottle. If you'd love to take a wine with you, but the glass bottle puts you off, this is the solution for you. Rolling down to a tiny size when empty, the PlatyPreserve does exactly what its name suggests, keeping a bottle's worth of wine fresh and flavourful for several weeks. Simply fill, squeeze out the air and seal for an easily transportable package. You may even find yourself using it at home. Add class to even the roughest camp meal - just remember to bring something to drink it from!]]></description>

It's pretty straightforward - the flexible foam tube slides easily over your Platypus Hoser or Big Zip drinking tube to keep its contents liquid for longer in freezing conditions. Then pop on the Bite Valve Cover to protect your mouthpiece from solidifying, replace the mouthpiece and you're ready for the cold stuff. Invaluable for staying hydrated on the move in the winter months.]]></description>

Reduce the number of cables you carry and keep your kit juiced, the Motormonkey is the silver bullet for electronics on the move.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The PowerTraveller Motormonkey is a handy little gadget for long car journeys with your devices - the world's smallest USB adapter. Sitting in your car's socket, it's virtually unnoticeable since the face lies flush. It's clever enough to stay there without draining the battery, then if you connect an Apple device, it changes its power settings accordingly. It even shuts down once your iPod, smartphone, camera battery or headtorch is fully charged. Reduce the number of cables you carry and keep your kit juiced, the Motormonkey is the silver bullet for electronics on the move.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Solar monkey adventurer is a slimline, compact 2-panel solar charger with a 2500mAh internal lithium polymer battery.  The clamshell design offers optimum weight-to-efficiency at just 265g and the 2 solar panels output 3 watt max.  The adventurer features auto-load, self sensing switching technology, meaning when a device is connected, the adventurer will automatically start to charge your device and will optimise the charging parameters required.The polysilicon solar panel offers photovoltaic efficiency up to 17% and features a USB 700mA @ 5v output, fully supporting Apple iPhones, iPads, iPods, mobile phones and other 5v gadgets such as portable games consoles, handheld GPS systems, e-readers, etc. The solar monkey adventurer also has a solar energy detection feature which activates the incorporated state-of-the-art MPPT (maximum power point tracker) technology, allowing it to charge your device more efficiently in low light conditions. The solar panels will charge the internal battery in just 12 hours in optimum light conditions.Users can also charge the solar monkey adventurer and their devices simultaneously, thus saving time.  You recharge the adventurer by the mains (UTC sold separately) via the  DC 5v 600mA socket or via the solar panel.  Whilst the adventurer is being charged the LED light will be red, once the internal battery is fully charged, this light will turn green.The kit comes with a handy carabiner so it can be attached to tents or rucksacks and is made from high quality durable materials which make it both water and shock resistant - perfect for the outdoor adventurer and the busy traveller.We've also included the white Apple monkeytail cable to allow easier connection to your Apple devices, as well as a specially designed travel case.The travel case is made from a tough, condura-type material and features a thermal insulation layer to protect the solar monkey adventurer from the elements.  The technical details inside the case include thin elasticated straps on both halves to hold the adventurer securely in place whilst the solar panel is open and an elastic self-securing buckle that fits through the hinge slots of the adventurer, ensuring it is held in place.  The top half of the case features a netted storage area for cables, etc and the tough, waterproof zip keeps the solar monkey adventurer protected.  External features include a hang loop at the top of the case and belt loops at the rear.Packed full with protection features including short-circuit protection, overload protection and low voltage protection and importantly, thermal insulation battery protection giving an operating temperature range of -10 to 90 degrees C, the solar monkey adventurer adds an exciting new dimension to the existing Powertraveller range.]]></description>

None of PackTowl's range of highly efficient towels are bulky, but this one will make you do a double-take.You could literally hide it in your hand, but then pull it out of the mesh bag and experience the smooth texture on your face and hands. When it's drenched, wring it out and go again - it'll take twice its own weight in water, then dry at top speed.

<description><![CDATA[New for 2011 this is Lifesystems' longest lasting repellent. Developed in conjunction with 3M, the Endurance insect repellent is a specially formulated cream with a unique time-release agent. This enables the DEET to evaporate at a slower rate, providing protection that lasts longer than standard repellents and with a lower concentration of DEET. Protection lasts for up to 12 hours.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[New for 2011 this is Lifesystems' longest lasting repellent. Developed in conjunction with 3M, the Endurance insect repellent is a specially formulated cream with a unique time-release agent. This enables the DEET to evaporate at a slower rate, providing protection that lasts longer than standard repellents and with a lower concentration of DEET. Protection lasts for up to 12 hours.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[With its revolutionary, patent-pending design made possible by Black Diamond's in-house hot forge, the Black Diamond GridLock Screwgate eliminates the dangers of cross loading. Designed specifically for belaying, the intuitive, easy-to-use GridLock isolates the belay loop behind its uniquely shaped gate, thereby keeping the carabiner in its proper orientation. The GridLock's I-beam spine transitions into a large, rounded rope-bearing surface for maximum strength and smooth rope feeding. Simply put, you'll never have to deal with a shifting, cross-loaded belay carabiner again.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Rockfax Beginners' Guide for Climbers is the instructional guide for young people starting out on the wall. Fully endorsed by the National Indoor Climbing Achievement Scheme (NICAS) and the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, it's a fun way to learn the basics of climbing between sessions.Illustrated throughout with attractive cartoon characters, the Beginners' Guide takes you in an easily understandable way through tying in and belaying to wall skills, equipment and knots. In fact, it covers everything you need to know for NICAS Levels 1 and 2, plus some of the Level 3 skills. It even comes with a length of cord so you can practice as you read. The first guidebook written specifically to appeal to a younger audience, it's a must-have for any budding climber learning the ropes.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The PowerGorilla by PowerTraveller is the next step in portable rechargeable power sources, able to provide an extra 2-5 hours of power on your laptop or up to 20 hours on various other electronic devices (see feature list).The PowerGorilla is an easy to use portable charger that will work with devices up to 24Volts, simply select the required voltage from 5V up to 24V using the one touch button, indicated on the LCD screen, and connect your device to start charging. This varied voltage enables the PowerGorilla to work with anything from your laptop to your iPod (other mp3 devices are available).There is also the option for you to charge the PowerGorilla from the mains power supply at the same time it is powering your laptop or even charge multiple devices at once through daisy-chaining.The PowerGorilla uses input voltage auto recognition technology which means that if you use your own AC laptop charger (between 16 - 24V only), it will automatically detect the voltage level and set the LCD display accordingly.The sleek, aluminium casing has additional shock resistant rubber protection strips, making it both stylish and practical. Having been field tested in some of the most extreme conditions in the world, including Afghanistan, Madagascar, Zambia, Antarctica and Norway, the PowerGorilla is a reliable and efficient power source designed to be taken on all your adventures, wherever they may take you.]]></description>

Made of durable stainless steel, the Nite Ize DoohicKey features half a dozen tools that do everything from tighten bolts and screws to open a bottle of 'refreshment', all in a simple key tool that fits in the palm of your hand.On one end of the DoohicKey is a sturdy carabiner clip, allowing you to attach keys to it, or attach the DoohicKey itself to any loop or ring. Opposite the clip is an etched ruler for on-the-spot measurements, and the carabiner opening is strategically shaped to function as a wrench.

<description><![CDATA[Buying a BioLite Camp Stove lets you get truly off-grid for long periods and supports a good cause, plus it charges your phone; what more could you want? If you're turning your back on civilisation for a while, obtaining fuel for cooking is a big consideration in the planning phase. So what if you could pick up the fuel around camp?EfficientThe BioLite Camping Stove does exactly that, with bells on. Not only does it burn the bits of dry stick and other biomass that you find near your camp, it burns it way more efficiently than your average campfire. A small proportion of the heat is used to drive air round the chamber to enable full, clean combustion. So it boils a litre of water in around 4.5 minutes. And that's before we mention the ability to turn waste heat into electricity to charge USB gadgets. Like your phone or an LED light or headtorch - those little things that make life easier out.CompactBecause you don't need fuel canisters or bottles, the space taken up by your stove on a long trip is also less with the BioLite Camp Stove. The thermoelectric generator (orange) on the side unhooks to stow snugly inside the chamber for transport and the legs fold in. So the whole thing takes up little more space than a wide-mouth bottle.Safe and funOf course, it's not only remote adventurers who will appreciate this handy device. Sat in the middle of a marshmallow-toasting group of mates it provides the appeal of a campfire with less smoke and less risk of spreading. Plus the satisfaction of collecting your own carbon-neutral fuel. This also means you're free to fly with the stove without being stymied for fuel at the other end!Even when you're back home the stove can come in useful. Whether you live in the remote Scottish Highlands or a suburb of London, if the power goes off it's good to be able to eat a hot meal and charge your phone. Even if you do have to go outdoors to do so.Supports a better worldBut buying this stove doesn't only provide you with a useful piece of cooking equipment. That's because BioLite use the proceeds to bring their Home Stove to  some of the 3 billion people who cook on open fires worldwide. Each Home Stove helps reduce the amount of fuel that needs to be collected and the amount of smoke produced during cooking. Which not only improves the health of the person cooking, but cuts carbon emissions too, contributing to a better world for everyone. And it provides a sustainable source of electricity that can be used for LED lights or a mobile phone for vital communications. For more information on the BioLite mission, see the BioLite website.So for conscience-friendly cooking when you head out camping, or reliable access to electricity in the middle of nowhere, take the BioLite Camp Stove and stay powered virtually anywhere.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Place the BioLite Portable Grill on the BioLite Camp Stove and open up a whole new world of flavour in your camp food. If you've ever wished you didn't have to fry everything while camping, you'll love the options afforded by this compact addition.Though it looks simple, some complex engineering has gone into making the grill user-friendly. Working with the Camp Stove's fan set to 'Lo', the flip-top chimney gives you control over the spread of the flames. It also means you can add fuel and stoke the fire without having to remove your food. Two heat zones let you cook different foods together and everything becomes infused with that fantastic woodsmoke flavour. Then the legs fold in, the carry cover clips on and off you go on the road again. Extend the possibilities of your BioLite Camp Stove and bring gourmet camp cooking within reach with the BioLite Portable Grill.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The BioLite Kettle Pot sits perfectly on top of the BioLite Camp Stove for boiling and cooking, then the stove fits inside for easy packing. Specifically designed to make the most of the Camp Stove's heat, the massive 1.5 litre capacity takes water for several wet meals or pasta for up to four. And you don't need to worry about scratching, since ultra-thin stainless steel doesn't have any sensitive coatings to flake off.The fold-away handle is another smart feature, forming a sturdy vertical grip for reliable pouring. The heat-retaining translucent lid is held on with a silicone seal, so you can pour your coffee with ease. And once you're well fed, the stove packs inside, so the whole package takes up little extra space. A well-designed addition to your BioLite Camp Stove, take the Kettle Pot too and you're set for as long as you're out there.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Leki Micro Vario Carbon Lady Trekking Poles are so light and easy to pack that you'll wonder how you ever got on strapping your sticks outside your pack. An evolution of the popular Leki Micro Sticks, Micro Varios offer a similarly lightweight solution with the added benefit of length adjustment to fine-tune them or for ascent.These particular poles are super-lightweight but even stronger than aluminium because they're made from pure carbon. Push-button assembly is quick and easy as well as highly reliable thanks to the kevlar-reinforced tensioning rope. The SpeedLock lever fastening provides 20cm of continuous length adjustment to get them the right length for you. Then when you reach the Via Ferrata or need to pack for your flight, just fold them down for a tiny 38 cm packed length, plenty small enough to go inside your pack or case.Lightweight doesn't have to mean compromising comfort either, since the hollow, ladies'-specific Aergon grip is rounded all over and made for slimmer hands. Plus the extended Thermo Mid grip offers an instant change in length for varied terrain. Versatile, strong and highly packable; the Micro Vario Carbon Lady pole is the lightweight hiker's dream pole.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Leki Micro Vario Carbon Lady Trekking Poles are so light and easy to pack that you'll wonder how you ever got on strapping your sticks outside your pack. An evolution of the popular Leki Micro Sticks, Micro Varios offer a similarly lightweight solution with the added benefit of length adjustment to fine-tune them or for ascent.These particular poles are super-lightweight but even stronger than aluminium because they're made from pure carbon. Push-button assembly is quick and easy as well as highly reliable thanks to the kevlar-reinforced tensioning rope. The SpeedLock lever fastening provides 20cm of continuous length adjustment to get them the right length for you. Then when you reach the Via Ferrata or need to pack for your flight, just fold them down for a tiny 38 cm packed length, plenty small enough to go inside your pack or case.Lightweight doesn't have to mean compromising comfort either, since the hollow, ladies'-specific Aergon grip is rounded all over and made for slimmer hands. Plus the extended Thermo Mid grip offers an instant change in length for varied terrain. Versatile, strong and highly packable; the Micro Vario Carbon Lady pole is the lightweight hiker's dream pole.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The superstrong Leki Cristallo Antishock screams durable comfort through every inch, from vented rubber handle to carbide tip. Tough aluminium tube makes up the body of this all-rounder of a trekking pole, ideal for hiking, trekking, ski-touring and more at any time of year.It's also secure - the Leki SpeedLock on the top joint offers quick, robust adjustment as you change terrain, whilst the SuperLock twist adjustment on the bottom joint holds a massive 140kg. The SuperLock has more tricks than that up its sleeve though, housing the SAS Lite sprung shock-absorbing system. This cushions your wrists from repeated impacts, supported as they are in the quick-drying air-textured straps. A great pole for use on hard surfaces and long journeys, the Cristallo Antishock will keep your hands comfortable all the way.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Leki Softlite trekking pole is lightweight and easy to use, but don't be thinking it's basic. No, this practical pole may be ideal for lightweight hiking, mountain marathons and ultralight backpacking, but it's also great for everything else too - from ambling up a munro to ski touring in the depths of winter.The poles' strength comes from the combination of high tensile strength aluminium with the reliable SpeedLock camming system. The pole itself is kept thin too, for even lower weight and a streamlined look. On top, the handle is shaped for comfort in most hands - soft rubber is vented and the tough wrist strap has a soft layer where it supports your wrist. So if you want one lightweight, reliable pole for all your self-propelled journeys, you can't go wrong with the Softlite by Leki.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Leki Trail pole was made for where reliability and strength are critical - high alpine routes and remote expeditions. They're all about strength, with thicker-than average tube sections and Leki SuperLock adjusters to hold huge amounts of weight when you need them to.That's not to say that trekking comfort is ignored though - the Round Top Comfort grip with Soft rubber is shaped to work with most walkers' hands, reducing the amount of force needed to hold the pole. And the adjustable webbing wriststrap supports all day at minimal weight. Ideal for hard ascents and rough terrain, the Trail is what you need to depend upon when you're a long way from anywhere.]]></description>

It's suitable for use on all footwear materials - fabrics, leather, Gore-Tex, even suede - and, once dry, you can't see or even feel it's there. Ideal for re-proofing your outdoor boots or shoes, but also for adding water-resistance to work shoes, fashion boots and pretty much anything else.

<description><![CDATA[Kill the stink with Storm Deodoriser, a quick and easy way to keep your shoes, helmet, gloves and everything else smelling fresher for longer. Being based on a solution of silver ions, a couple of pumps of this effectively stop bacteria reproducing in your gear. And since it's their waste that does the smelling, the less bacteria there are, the less your kit stinks.Supplied in a handy-sized spray, the ideal is to give each item a quick spray while it's still warm after use. The first spray should last about a week, then the build-up effect makes subsequent treatments last longer. The more occasions you spray, the better it works. Any waterproofing on the inside won't be affected and the light fragrance immediately masks that warm feet smell so your kit bag or wardrobe doesn't cause asphyxiation. A smart solution for all those items that you dread taking off at the end of a warm day.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Storm Fast Dry Proofer does exactly that - restores  or adds a DWR finish to tents, backpacks, clothing and any other fabric quickly, easily and eco-friendly-ly. It won't stain, dries at speed and leaves breathability untouched - sounds almost too good to be true, but we've seen it in action!The environmental credentials stem from the C6 fluorocarbons it's based on. These are less harmful than the C8 fluorocarbons used in most proofers if they get into water courses etc. Plus because it's in a handy spray can for direct application, less gets wasted between can and gear. It also doesn't require a heat treatment, so there's no energy used there either. It's as simple as spraying it evenly over the surface and leaving it to dry; add weather protection in minutes with Storm Fast Dry Proofer.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Try it and you'll love the ease and simplicity of the Storm Eco+ Twin Pack for cleaning and proofing all your outdoor clothes - in one wash! That's right, both products go in the washing machine drawer at the same time! And between them they remove dirt and reinstate the DWR coating on 2-3 garments of any type, all in one 30 degree cycle. There's no need to scrub your machine drawer or do an empty cycle beforehand either - the Storm Proofing system is designed to make it easy to look after your gear.But that's not the only advantage. The Storm Eco+ proofing system is also very environmentally friendly. That's because it has a C0 formulation that completely avoids the use of the potentially harmful fluorocarbons that you'll find in the majority of other proofers. The only trade-off is that your gear will need a bit of heat to cure the treatment - once dry, a spell on low in the tumble-dryer or under a cool iron (and a tea-towel) will do the trick. Having done this, your waterproofs, softshells, insulated clothes, gloves, fleeces or whatever you want to proof, will be just as water-repellent, if not more so, than when new. Plus it's actually more abrasion-resistant than other treatments in testing. Worth a try, wouldn't you say? Especially as 300ml will do four wash loads. Experience the future of DWR treatment with the Storm Proofing system.]]></description>

The only trade-off is that your gear will need a bit of heat to cure the treatment - once dry, a spell on low in the tumble-dryer or under a cool iron (and a tea-towel) will do the trick. Having done this, your waterproofs, softshells, insulated clothes, gloves, fleeces or whatever you want to proof, will be just as water-repellent, if not more so, than when new. Plus it's actually more abrasion-resistant than other treatments in testing. Worth a try, wouldn't you say? Especially as 300ml will do four wash loads. Experience the future of DWR treatment with the Storm Proofing system.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Try it and you'll love the ease and simplicity of the Storm Eco+ Twin Pack for cleaning and proofing all your outdoor clothes - in one wash! That's right, both products go in the washing machine drawer at the same time! And between them they remove dirt and reinstate the DWR coating on 2-3 garments of any type, all in one 30 degree cycle. There's no need to scrub your machine drawer or do an empty cycle beforehand either - the Storm Proofing system is designed to make it easy to look after your gear.But that's not the only advantage. The Storm Eco+ proofing system is also very environmentally friendly. That's because it has a C0 formulation that completely avoids the use of the potentially harmful fluorocarbons that you'll find in the majority of other proofers.

It's actually more abrasion-resistant than other treatments, believe it or not. And because it's C0 ie fluorocarbon-free, it's not going to harm the environment. Is there anything more you could want? Keep your gear at its best without harming the environment, the Storm Eco+ Proofer Spray makes light work of blocking heavy weather.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Storm Eco+ Proofer forms the business end of the Storm Proofing System, giving you an easily applied but highly effective DWR for virtually any fabric. Designed for use in your washing machine, it goes in the drawer at the same time as the Storm Cleaner for cleaning and proofing in one cycle.But it's ecologically sound as well as straightforward to use. Completely free of fluorocarbons, PFOA and PFOS, the dendromer-based technology is approved by Greenpeace. It lasts longer than some other treatments because it'se more abrasion-resistant. And because only one cycle is needed, it uses less water than other systems. Plus it's more economical, giving you four wash loads of 2-3 garments out of each 300ml bottle. The only trade-off is the need for heat to cure the treatment - once dry, a spell on low in the tumble-dryer or under a cool iron (and a tea-towel) will do the trick. It's ideal for anything you want to repel water (as long as it fits in your washing machine) - hardshells, softshells, fleeces, windshells and more. An easy to use, eco-friendly proofer that will stay in place for longer - is this the ideal product for maintaining your waterproof gear?]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Storm Cleaner gently but effectively cleans all your technical outdoor gear without excess foam or stubborn residues being left on your clothes. It also forms part of the Storm Proofing system - if you put Storm Proofer into the fabric softener section of the washer you can do both in one wash cycle and save water. That's because it's pH neutral, so even in hard water you don't get the reaction that leaves those streaky white marks. You can also use it to handwash individual or bulky items like rucksacks. Totally PFC-free and happiest at 30 degrees, Storm Cleaner is the eco-friendly cleaner for all your outdoor gear.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Storm Cleaner gently but effectively cleans all your technical outdoor gear without excess foam or stubborn residues being left on your clothes. It also forms part of the Storm Proofing system - if you put Storm Proofer into the fabric softener section of the washer you can do both in one wash cycle and save water. That's because it's pH neutral, so even in hard water you don't get the reaction that leaves those streaky white marks. You can also use it to handwash individual or bulky items like rucksacks. Totally PFC-free and happiest at 30 degrees, Storm Cleaner is the eco-friendly cleaner for all your outdoor gear.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[With the Camelbak All Clear purification system you have UV water treatment and storage facilities in one handy package - ideal for minimalist and fast-moving trips. Not only is it compact, the All Clear system is quick and easy to use too - no pumping, tablets or waiting around. Simply fill, switch on and agitate for 60 seconds for reliably safe drinking water.There are a couple of provisos - the water must be clear for the UV light to penetrate, but there's a pre-filter available separately that helps stop debris getting in when you're out in the wilds. And it's not too happy at freezing temperatures, so you'll have to keep it in your jacket if you're going somewhere cold. But apart from those it's ready for anything, deactivating viruses and protozoa as well as bacteria from springs, streams, taps and any other sources you find on your travels. It also comes with a case and simple cap so you can protect the treatment cap on the move. A seriously useful bit of kit to avoid carrying all your water on your back, the All Clear system makes it safer to rely on nature.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Camelbak All Clear Pre-Filter sits neatly over the neck of your All Clear bottle while filling, to keep your water as clean as possible for treatment. The All Clear system works effectively only on water that's clear and without 'bits', so it's important to keep your water as clean as possible from the very start.Not only does this sturdy pre-filter prevent debris like sediment, insects, plant parts and worse from getting into your bottle. It's also a safeguard that protects the threaded neck from the untreated water, adding to your safety. A vital addition to your All Clear system when you'll be filling it from streams and rivers etc on a remote trip.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The CamelBak 3L Antidote Reservoir is a fully featured water reservoir with a low profile design and centre baffling, it offers excellent stability and easy pack loading. The Quick Link System allows the tube to disconnect cleanly and uses an auto shut-off feature to stop any drips or spills from one end while the Big Bite Valve mouth piece self-seals immediately after use on the other.The taste of the water is kept pure and fresh using CamelBak's PureFlow Tube, thus ensuring your drink stays refreshing and doesn't carry the 'plastic' taste of some other systems. More than fresh tasting, the Antidote uses HydroGuard technology to provide anti-microbial protection. This is accomplished by inhibiting the growth of bacteria that can often cause odours, discolouration and deterioration of the bottle.]]></description>
